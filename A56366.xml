            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Induſtrious and Judicious Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, doth here preſent thee with two diſtinct Tractates concerning the Chriſtian Sabbath, or Lords Day: In the former, the Divine Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it is cleerly proved; In the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the time of its beginning is particularly determined. In the former, the erronious conſcience, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies the morality of the fourth Commandement, is ſtrongly convinced: In the latter, the ſcrupulous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, which doubts of the time when the Sabbath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, is fully ſatisfied.</p>
                  <p>In both, the ſerious Reader will find great profit and delight; The whole Diſcourſe being illaborate and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous, wherein beſides the main points intended in it, divers other matters of important Cognizance are oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally decided, and diſcuſſed, and many obſcure Scriptures are excellently explained according to the genuine ſenſe thereof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:44298:4"/>
And this learned Diſcourſe hath its birth in a very ſeaſonable time, in reſpect of that wofull defection and Apoſtacy that is among us, as from the truth and wayes of God in general, ſo in a ſpecial manner from the Religious eſteem and obſervation of the Lords day.</p>
                  <p>For never ſince the light of the bleſſed and glorious Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt ſhined upon this our <hi>Goſhen,</hi> was the Sabbath Day ſo wickedly neglected and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaned by the generality of people, and the Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution thereof ſo ſhamefully denyed, and decried by many pretenders to Religion, as it is at this day.</p>
                  <p>And therefore (Good Reader) we heartily commend this neceſſary and uſefull work to thy diligent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſal, and thy ſelf, and thy humble and ſincere in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries after Truth, unto the guidance and bleſsing of the God of all Truth.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>And this I ſhall endeavour to make evident by proving theſe two points</p>
                  <p n="1">I <hi>That</hi> Adam <hi>diſobeyed and fell in the ſame ſixth day in which he was created and made.</hi>

                     <p>Object. <hi>Here it may be objected, that</hi> Moſes <hi>doth firſt ſet down the ſtory of</hi> Adams <hi>creation, in</hi> Gen. 1. <hi>and then he</hi>
                        <pb n="2" facs="tcp:44298:11"/>
                        <hi>doth ſet down the Inſtitution of the Sabbath in the beginning of</hi> Gen. 2. 2, 3. <hi>which is in order of time before the ſtory of</hi> Adams <hi>Temptation and Fall, in</hi> Chap. 3.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Though <hi>Moſes</hi> doth place the Inſtitution of the Sabbath, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 2 3. before the ſtory of <hi>Adams</hi> fall; yet it is evident that he doth place it there onely by the figure <hi>Hyſteron Proteron</hi> (not becauſe he had done with the ſtory of the Sixth day in the firſt Chapter, but becauſe that ſtory being large) he would firſt in a brief ſort lay down the ſtory of all the ſeven dayes of the week together, which he doth from the beginning of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſis</hi> to the end of the third verſe of the ſecond Chapter, and then he returns again to ſpeak of the ſtory of the ſixth day more at large, and makes a larger Narration of the Creation, and Fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> from the ſeventh verſe of the ſecond Chapter, to the end of the third Chapter, with variety of inlargements more than was in the firſt Chapter; for repetitions have uſually many new additions; and ſo in true Chronology, and in the order of ſtory, the Inſtitution of the Sabbath in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 2, 3. muſt be placed at the end of <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. as I have after diſcuſſed the matter in that Text.</p>
                     <p>And the method of <hi>Moſes</hi> in this large ſtory of the ſixth day, is very obſervable, and lyes thus.</p>

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:44298:13"/>
pureſt nature craves daily food, as we may ſee by our Saviours hungring, and by all new-born creatures; neither was <hi>Adam</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated to laſt for want of food, for variety of food was ſet before him, and free liberty to eat thereof, verſ. 16. neither was <hi>Adams</hi> appetite hindred through any infirmity of nature, for as God had created variety of food for their eating, ſo doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he created a true naturall appetite in them to deſire food (at the firſt convenient opportunity) though their appetite was not irregular and painful to them as ours is to us.</p>
                     <p>And doubtleſſe the devill was not ignorant that <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> had a true naturall appetite to deſire food, and therefore without any delay he fitted his temptation ſuitable to their natural ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, and the like crafty policie he uſed to our Saviour when he was an hungry, and becauſe there was no meat pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for him in a readineſſe as there was for <hi>Adam,</hi> he fitted his temptation thereafter, ſaying, <hi>If thou be the Son of God, make this ſtone bread,</hi> Mat. 4.

                     <p>And therefore thoſe Mariage-Books, ſaith Mr. <hi>Broughton,</hi> have an over-ſight, that ſay, The woman was formed in Paradiſe; for the Commandement <hi>Thou ſhalt not eat thereof,</hi> in verſ. 17. went not before the creation of the woman (nor before her mariage to <hi>Adam)</hi> but after; ſhe had the Commandement as well as <hi>Adam,</hi> in the ſame term <hi>Thou,</hi> as being but one fleſh by mariage. See <hi>Bro.</hi> in principal Poſitions Pag. 10. and the matter is out of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, for the woman doth teſtifie that the Commadement was given to them both joyntly; for thus ſaith ſhe to the Serpent, <hi>God hath ſaid, ye ſhall not eat of it, neither ſhall ye touch it leſt ye dye<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> Gen. 3. 3. in this ſentence ſhe doth three times over affirm that Gods prohibition was given to them both joyntly.</p>
                     <p>The ſtory of the time of <hi>Adams</hi> mariage lyes thus: Firſt, God in the ſixth day created all ſorts of Beaſts of the Earth, and all ſorts of the Fowls of the air: Secondly, Then he created <hi>Adam</hi> after his own Image, as the glory of all his creation; And thirdly, then he brought all the ſaid creatures before him, that he might put ſuitable names upon them as their Lord, and that they might wait upon him as their Lord, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 19, 20. But fourthly, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe among them all, God did not find out a meet helper for <hi>Adams</hi> ſociety, thereupon God as a moſt expert Surgeon, did caſt <hi>Adam</hi> into a deep ſleep, and took out one of his Ribs, and of that Rib, as a moſt mighty Creator, he made a woman; and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:44298:15"/>
this was the laſt ſort of viſible creatures that God made. Fifthly, Then God brought her unto <hi>Adam,</hi> to ſee what <hi>Adam</hi> would call her, and he being exquiſite in underſtanding ſaid, <hi>This now is bone of my bone, and fleſh of my fleſh, ſhe ſhall be called Woman, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe was taken out of man.</hi> And ſixthly, At this inſtant, God gave her in mariage to <hi>Adam,</hi> to be as one fleſh, and to be a meet helper to him. And therefore ſecondly, the onely reaſon why the womans creation, and mariage, is not recorded till after the mention of <hi>Adams</hi> ſeating in Paradiſe, is, becauſe by the figure <hi>Hyſteron Proteron,</hi> he would ſhew the cloſe joyning of the Devils temptation, and of their Fall, to their mariage.</p>

                     <p>Our minds (ſaith Mr. <hi>Bro.</hi> in <hi>Req.</hi> of Conſent. pag. 75.) cannot once think of any other ſubject in God (who dwelleth in terrible light) againſt which the Devill durſt ſpurn, neither deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth he but to hurt man; as ſtill ſhewing that from hatred to man was his Fall.</p>
                     <p>Envy (ſaith <hi>Lanquet)</hi> came firſt of Sathan, for envying the feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of man whom God had created and ſet in Paradiſe, he chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged himſelf into an Angel of light, abuſing the wiſdome of the Serpent to deceive man. See <hi>Marbek's</hi> Common-places, pag. 339.</p>
                     <p>At the creation of the woman (which was the laſt particular kind of all Gods creation) the Angels were not fallen; for at the end of Gods viſible creation on the ſixth day, It is ſaid, <hi>That God ſaw all that he had made, and loe it was very good,</hi> Gen. 1. 31.</p>
                     <p>From this Text it may certainly be gathered, that no creature was yet become bad; and therefore that the Angels were not fallen when the woman was created; but their fall was preſently after the woman was created and given in mariage to <hi>Adam;</hi> all which was done without the borders of Paradiſe, but then God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to bring them into Paradiſe, all creatures whom <hi>Adam</hi> had named as their Lord were to attend upon him, and then God gave his Angels charge alſo to atend upon them (as I have

                     <p>No other time I think can be found for the time of the Angels fall, but this, as I have formerly noted; And therefore as ſoon as God had brought <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> into Paradiſe, and all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures both viſible and inviſible to attend him, then that number of the Angels that fell for refuſing to ſerve man, took ſpeciall notice of Gods Command and Covenant with <hi>Adam</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the two Trees, and concerning the condition of his nature <note place="margin">The true na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the firſt Convenant ſtood in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, or in diſobedience, to a poſitive, and not to a moral com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.

I ſay the fallen Angels did take ſpecial notice of the true nature of this firſt Covenant with <hi>Adam;</hi> and therefore with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out delay they did preſently joyn together in one head or head-plot to beguile the woman, by inticing her to eat of the forbidden fruit before ſhe might have the opportunity to eat firſt of the tree of life; and the better to effect this head-plot of theirs, they did firſt reaſon with God againſt the nature of <hi>Adam</hi> (as they did after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards againſt <hi>Job)</hi> ſaying, That his nature was not more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect than theirs was by creation; and therefore that <hi>Adam</hi> would diſobey Gods poſitive command as they had done, if they might have but leave to try him. Now God being a cunning and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Work-man would not be out-bidden by Sathans brags, and therefore he gave Sathan leave to do his worſt (as he did afterwards give him leave to do his worſt to Chriſt) for he knew that if his workmanſhip ſhould fail upon the triall, he could tell how to mend it, and how to make it better able to indure the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all for time to come.</p>

                     <p>The Image of God wherewith <hi>Adams</hi> Nature was adorned, would have kept him, and all his Poſterity for ever from death, if he had but firſt eaten of the Tree of Life; but becauſe he did firſt eat of the forbidden Fruit, he was deprived of Gods Image; And then ſecondly, Death in Sin fell upon his Nature.</p>
                     <p>When the Souls of men are Created and placed in their Bodies, (ſaith Mr. <hi>Perkins)</hi> God forſakes them not in regard of their ſubſtance, or faculties of their Soul, but only in reſpect of his <note place="margin">See <hi>Perkins</hi> on the Creed, p. 162.</note> own Image, whereof the Soul is deprived.</p>
                     <p>And he asketh this queſtion, How can the Soul dye the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Death? His anſwer is, That the Soul dyeth not by being utterly aboliſhed, but becauſe it is as though it were not; and becauſe it ceaſeth to be in reſpect of Righteouſneſſe, and Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with God; and indeed (ſaith he) this is the death of all deaths, when the Creature hath ſubſiſting and being, and yet is deprived of all comfortable fellowſhip with God.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 The ſecond degree of that Death threatned in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17. was death in ſin, and this death fell upon <hi>Adams</hi> nature at the very <note place="margin">See <hi>Perkins</hi> in the right way of dying wel.</note> inſtant, as ſoon as God had ſubſtracted his Image from him; for we ſee by experience, that as ſoon as the God of Nature hath ſubſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted the light of the Sun from our Horizon, there remains no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but obſcure darkneſs, and then no Artificers, nor Scholars can work, or write after their Maſters perfect Copy, but inſtead thereof, they work, and act irregularly, and tranſgreſs againſt their Maſters copy; Even ſo, as ſoon as God in Juſtice had ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted the Light and Life of his Image from <hi>Adam,</hi> what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained but obſcure darkneſs in his minde, and then what could he do elſe but think and act irregularly, and that continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as long as he did continue in that darkneſs? and this dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs after the light it ſelf is myſtically applied to mans corrupt eſtate, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 18. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 8. being alienated from the life of God. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 1.</p>

then follows a defect, or want of righteouſneſs, and I may alſo ſay, then follows a natural proneſs to all kinde of iniquity, ſo that the very thoughts and imaginations of the heart are only e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and that continually, and this frame is called Original ſin to us, though <hi>Adams</hi> Original ſin was his actual eating of the forbid-Fruit; and this is the ſecond degree of that death threatned in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 A third degree of that death was, that Adam was now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the power and ſlavery of Satan (which had the power of death, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 14.) to do his wil and pleaſure in all things to the full, and to be under the power of a Tyrant is death, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18. 4. But it pleaſed God in his eternal Counſel and Providence to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide Jeſus Chriſt to take poſſeſſion of the world as the right Heir of it, as ſoon as <hi>Adam</hi> fel, and ſo to uphold all things by the word of his power, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 2, 3. by which means both Satans power, tyranny, and malice, and mans corrupt deſires and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours are reſtrained, and ordered ſo, that now they cannot do that wickedneſs which elſe they would do; and were it not for <note place="margin">See <hi>Capel</hi> on <hi>Tempt.</hi> p. 55, 56. and ſee more in ch. 3. in <hi>R.</hi> 2.</note> this Government of Chriſt at the inſtant of <hi>Adams</hi> fall, no man can imagine what deſtructive miſchiefs would have faln at that very inſtant upon the whole Creation, which was the very thing that Satan aimed at in his temptation; but bleſſed be God that provided Jeſus Chriſt againſt that time of need.</p>
                     <p>But after this digreſſion in ſetting out the degrees of the firſt Spiritual death, as it muſt be underſtood, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17. I will now return to ſpeak a little more of the Devils ſpeech and ſubtilty, in deceiving the Woman, and in making her his inſtrument to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive <hi>Adam;</hi> The Devil did not deal with the Woman about any Morall diſobedience (as he did with Chriſt, after he had tried him with many other temptations for forty days together) for he knew that <hi>Adams</hi> nature was framed after Gods Image in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of Moral perfection, but he deals with her about poſitive commands only, for he knew that ſhe was not ſo perfect in the knowledge of thoſe things by Creation, as ſhe was in all Moral things; he knew that the Woman was ignorant as yet of the poſitive Law that was given to the Angels to attend upon them, (as the viſible Creatures were,) for they being Spirits, their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and actions were not ſubject to be diſcerned by bodily ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and in that reſpect alſo <hi>Eve</hi> was ignorant of their diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

and fall, and ſhe was alſo ignorant that they had obtained leave of God to tempt her about the Tree of Knowledge (which was a thing indifferent in its own nature to be eaten, or refuſed) but if the Woman had but known of theſe things, then her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and Natural wiſdome would have fortified her will againſt all Satans temptations whatſoever; for we ſee by the example of Chriſt, that when the Devil did perſwade him by <hi>Peters</hi> tongue to pitty himſelf, and not to go to <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> to ſuffer, then Chriſt could not be deceived by his perſwaſions, becauſe he knew that <hi>Peters</hi> tongue was acted by Satan, and therefore hee ſaid unto <hi>Peter, Get thee behind me Satan, thou art an offence unto me,</hi> Mat. 16. 23. but for the manner of this knowledge, the Woman could not call this Angel Satan, and therefore ſhe could not reſiſt ſo ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly, as elſe doubtleſs ſhe would have done; yea, if the Angels that fell had but known of Mans glory by Gods election in Chriſt, they would not have refuſed to ſerve man, for in this manner the Apoſtle doth reaſon about the Sin of the Princes of this World, had they but known (ſaith he) of the hidden Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, which he ordained before the world unto our glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, they would not have Crucified the Lord of glory, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 7, 8. ſo I may ſay of the Womans Fall, if ſhe had but known of the fall of Angels, ſhe would not have been deceived by the Serpent.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe the Woman was ignorant of thoſe poſitive Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets (and God was pleaſed not to reveal them to her as yet) ſhe was deceived, and then ſhe was eaſily made Satans Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to deceive her Husband; and then they did experimentally know that ſome of the Angels were faln, and that they had leave of God to tempt them, and that the Devil was a Liar, and a Murtherer from the beginning, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 44. The <hi>Syriack</hi> on the word <hi>Beginning,</hi> is <hi>Men Breſhith,</hi> that is, by all Rabbins, within the days of Creation, and ſaith Mr. <hi>Perkins,</hi> Our Saviour calls <note place="margin">See <hi>Perkins</hi> on the Creed.</note> the Devil a Man-ſlayer from the beginning, not from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Creation, or of Time, but of Man; and ſeeing (ſaith he) it is the nature of the Devil to ſhew his malice (againſt Man) with out ceaſing, no doubt but he took the firſt occaſion that might poſſible be had to bring man to the ſame Damnation with himſelf.</p>
                     <p>And why is the Devil ſaid to go up and down, or to walk a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:44298:158"/>
ſeeking whom he may devour, like a roaring Lion? but to expreſs his ſpeedy diligence in his firſt temptation, as well as in his after temptations? 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 8.</p>
                     <p>And why is the Devil called the Old Serpent, <hi>Revel.</hi> 12. but from his ancient deceiving of the underſtanding and will of our firſt Parents? And why is he ſaid to have the power of Death? <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 14. but from his firſt prevailing temptation, in prevailing with our firſt Parents to eat of the forbidden Fruit.

                     <p>And thus <hi>Adam</hi> in Honour (Created after Gods Image) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood not (for as yet he underſtood not that any of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels were become Devils, or that they ſpake with the tongue of the Serpent) <hi>he was like the Beaſts that periſh,</hi> Pſal. 49. 20.</p>

                     <p>2 And more eſpecially, becauſe it was laid upon him by God as a neceſſary duty; for God inforced his obedience to that act by an expreſſe command, ſaying, <hi>Be fruitfull, and multiply, and fill the earth,</hi> Gen. 1. 28. Hence it follows,</p>
                     <p>1 That they would not have omitted the act of Generation as ſoon as they had a fit opportunity, which they ſhould have had if they had ſlept but one night together in their innocency.</p>

(as ſome ignorant perſons do underſtand it, for God was come to the very place where <hi>Adam</hi> was,) But into what caſe haſt thou brought thy ſelf by eating of the forbidden fruit? And unto this ſearching Query, <hi>Adam</hi> made a plain Anſwer, ſaying in ver. 10. <hi>I heard thy voyce walking in the Garden, and I was afraid; and becauſe I was naked of thy Image in which I was created, I hid my ſelf.</hi>

And this dreadfull voice of God did ſo terrifie his guilty conſcience, that it forced <hi>Adam</hi> to ſay, <hi>I heard thy voice walking like Thunder in the Garden, and I was afraid;</hi> for the guilt of his conſcience told him that he had grievouſly tranſgreſſed againſt Gods poſitive command in ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the forbidden fruit.</p>

2 He gives another reaſon why he hid himſelf among the trees of the Garden, namely becauſe I was naked both in body and ſoul of my created qualities, and therefore I hid my ſelf among the trees of the Garden.</p>
                  <p>And thus <hi>Adams</hi> conſcience was convinced of his ſin, and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with Gods dreadfull voice of inquiry concerning his ſin and guilt, and thereupon he made a plain confeſſion, <hi>That he was afraid, and that he hid himſelf becauſe he was naked.</hi>

                  <p>The Text runs thus, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 8. <hi>They heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the Garden in the cool (or in the wind) of the day: And</hi> Adam <hi>and his wife hid themſelves from the preſence of the Lord God among the trees of the Garden,</hi> verſ. 9. <hi>And the Lord God called unto</hi> Adam, <hi>and ſaid unto him, Where art thou?</hi> verſ. 10. <hi>And he ſaid, Who told thee that thou waſt naked?

                  <p>God did purpoſely enter into a parly and communication with <hi>Adam,</hi> that thereby he might prepare him for a Reconciliation, ſaying to him in ver. 11. <hi>Who told thee that thou art naked?</hi> By this and the former ſearching Queries, God was pleaſed to help <hi>Adam</hi> to ſearch himſelf the more deeply, and to affect him the more throughly with the ſight of his ſin, and with the ſenſe of his miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſpiritual death in ſin, becauſe he intended to ſhew him mercy; but the Lord did not propound any ſuch ſearching Queries to the fallen Angels, becauſe he intended not to ſhew any merciful At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement or Reconciliation to them, though notwithſtanding he hath ſhewed ſome common mercy to them in that he hath not ſunk them into the loweſt hell as yet, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. 29.

                  <p>And theſe ſearching queres made <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> to anſwer (as thoſe that are deeply convinced, and humbled in the ſight and ſenſe of their Spiritual nakedneſſe and miſery) that they had eaten of the forbidden Fruit; and they freely confeſſed (without any extenuation) after what manner they were brought unto it; <hi>The woman</hi> (ſaith <hi>Adam,</hi> in verſ. 12.) <hi>which thou gaveſt to be with me, ſhe gave me of the tree, and I did eat;</hi> even ſhe that was made of my Rib, and ſhe that thou gaveſt to be a meet Helper unto me, <note place="margin">Gen. 3. 12<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Gen. 3. 13.</note> ſhe gave it unto me, and therefore I took it from her hand, (from whom I could ſuſpect no hurt) and did eat.</p>
                  <p>And the Lord ſaid unto the Woman, what is this that thou haſt done? or, why haſt thou done this? And the Woman ſaid, <hi>The Serpent</hi> (whom thou gaveſt to attend upon us, as a diligent and faithful ſervant) <hi>be guiled me, and I did eat,</hi> ver. 13. I thought the Serpent had been acted by a good Angel, that could not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade to ſin; and by this word <hi>Beguiled</hi> the woman compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended the whole manner and order of the Devils deceitful temptation.</p>
                  <p>Some Interpreters I grant do conceive, That <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> in their ſeveral anſwers, did not make a plaine confeſſion, but did rather labour to extenuate their ſin, by poſting it off from themſelves to others, but all circumſtances conſidered, their anſwers and confeſſions muſt needs be plain and naked, or elſe they had not been fit to imbrace the means of Reconciliation which God was now pleaſed to manifeſt unto them.</p>
                  <p>And therefore without delay God did firſt curſe the Serpent, as it was the Devils inſtrument, in verſ. 14. and then ſecondly, he curſeth the Devil himſelf, in ver. 15. ſaying, <hi>I will put enmity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thee and the Woman, and between thy ſeed and her ſeed;</hi> He, even He, ſhall break thy head, and thou ſhalt peirce Him in the foot-ſoals. Thus God did threaten the Devil in the Serpent, namely, to break in peeces his ſubtil Head-plot by the work of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Reconciliation, which ſhould be wrought by the Seed of this Woman, which the Devil had poyſoned and corrupted, thinking thereby to deſtroy all Man-kinde that ſhould come of her to the end of the World; but God threatned the Devil to break this Head-plot of his, and that he woud put ſuch an enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

in the Seed of the Woman againſt him and his ſeed, as ſhould prevail, and bring them all to a deeper ruine at laſt; and as God did thus curſe the Devils Head-plot to ruinate it by the Seed of the Woman, in the hearing and preſence of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> (to whom it was a Prophetical Prediction and a Promiſe) ſo que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionleſſe he did not fail to inſtruct them more fully herein, and after what manner this Seed of the Woman ſhould break the Devils Head-plot, namely, that through Death he ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy him that had the power of Death, that is the Devil, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 2. 14. and that he ſhould ſpoil Principalities and Powers, and make a ſhew of them openly, triumphing over them in his Death on the Croſſe, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 15. for he overcame him that had the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Death by Death, for his Soul was not ſeparated from his Body by the power of Satan, and his inſtruments, and by the power of their tortures, but by his own power, and in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect his death was accepted of God as a propitiatory Sacrifice of Attonement, and reconciliation.

And ſecondly, becauſe ſhe was the firſt Woman that did live by faith, therefore ſhe muſt needs be the Mother of all that ſhould after live by faith in her Seed Chriſt, and in that reſpect ſhe, as well, or rather more fully than <hi>Sara,</hi> may well be called the Mother of all that do live by faith, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 6. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 22. 28. 31.</p>

                  <p>Immediatly before this, not only the Woman, but <hi>Adam</hi> alſo were Spiritually dead in corruption and ſin; but it pleaſed God to take ſuch a ſpeedy courſe for their humiliation and convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and for their reconciliation and converſion by the Seed of the Woman, that <hi>Adam</hi> thereupon, in teſtimony both of his own faith and of his Wifes faith, did by way of excellency call her <hi>Hevah,</hi> and ſo he changed her name from <hi>Iſha</hi> to <hi>Hevah,</hi> that is to ſay, from woman to life.</p>

                  <argument>

                        <hi>Proving that</hi> Adam <hi>and</hi> Eve <hi>were Re-created before the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day, namely, in the latter part of the ſixth day.</hi>

                  </argument>
                  <p>I Will labour to make this evident by a double inference:</p>
                  <p n="1">1 From the word Hoſt, and Finiſhed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 1.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 From the word Had made, and Finiſhed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 2.</p>
                  <p>But for the better diſcerning of the ſaid Inferences, I will firſt labour to explain the text in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 1, 2, 3.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>And the Heavens and the Earth were Finiſhed, and all the Hoſt of them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>And before the ſeventh day, God had finiſhed the work that he had made; And he reſted on the ſeventh day from all the work that he had made.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſe 3. <hi>And God bleſſed the ſeventh day, and ſanctified it, becauſe in it be had reſted from all his works which God had created and made.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Two things muſt be marked for the better underſtanding of theſe words.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Touching the tranſlation of the word <hi>Before,</hi> in verſ. 2.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Touching the circumſtance of time: namely, after how much time, or Chronology of ſtory, the ſecond and third verſes concerning the Inſtitution of the Sabbath muſt be placed.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Touching the tranſlation of the word <hi>[Before]</hi> the ſeventh day, verſe. 2.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 The Seventy Tranſlators tranſlate it thus; In the ſixth day God ended all his works, they put the ſixth day into the Text inſtead of the ſeventh day, and this they did, leſt the Heathens, at whoſe requeſt that Tranſlation was made, ſhould think that God encled his works in the ſeventh day.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Therefore, to prevent this, and ſuch like groſſe miſtakes, I have made choice to follow Mr. <hi>Broughtons</hi> correction of the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva</hi> Tranſlation, where inſtead of <hi>In the ſeventh day,</hi> he reads <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſeventh day, God had finiſhed the work that he had made.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2 The word <hi>[Before]</hi> is better than the word <hi>[In]</hi> becauſe it is more agreeable to the ſenſe of the words adjoyning; for the frame of the next words are delivered in the Pretertenſe, <hi>Had finiſhed, Had made &amp;c.</hi> Theſe termes do carry the work of the Creation to have been Finiſhed, not <hi>In,</hi> but <hi>Before the ſeventh day;</hi> as if <hi>Moſes</hi> in more words had ſaid thus,</p>

                  <p n="3">3 Mr. <hi>Ainſworth</hi> ſheweth that the Prepoſition <hi>In,</hi> ought ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to be tranſlated <hi>Before,</hi> as in <hi>Exod.</hi> 17. 6. <hi>In the eyes of the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Iſrael,</hi> is better read thus, <hi>Before the eyes of the Elders of Iſrael,</hi> likewiſe in <hi>Deut.</hi> 25. 9. <hi>She ſhall ſpit in his face,</hi> is better read thus, <hi>She ſhall ſpit Before his face,</hi> namely, Before the face of her husbands brother, in way of reproach to him, becauſe he refuſed to raiſe up ſeed to his brother and ſo the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand her ſpitting to be, not <hi>In,</hi> but <hi>Before</hi> his face upon the ground, as aſign of R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>I grant that the letter of this Prepoſition doth differ from that in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 2. but yet by the rules of Grammar they muſt ſuffer the like variation, when there is the like cauſe, the difference of the letter doth nothing alter the caſe.</p>
                  <p>So in the eyes of <hi>Jehovah, Deut.</hi> 4. 25 <hi>Deut.</hi> 31. 29. is better read thus, <hi>Before the eyes of Jehovah;</hi> So in the New Teſtament it is ſaid, <hi>In or within the Ark was put the golden pot of Manna, and Asrons Rod,</hi>

                  <p>So then from all theſe conſiderations, it is cleer that the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Prepoſition ought ſometimes to be tranſlated <hi>Before,</hi> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times

                     <hi>After,</hi> as well as <hi>In,</hi> not onely in reſpect of perſon and place, but alſo in reſpect of time; and therefore this Text of <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 3. ought to be tranſlated thus, Before the ſeventh day, God had finiſhed (namely by a Re-creation) the work that he had made; the <hi>Greek</hi> tranſlate the work which God had begun to make, for at firſt it was made but mutably perfect in the former part of the ſixth day.</p>
                  <p>2 The next conſiderable Rule of direction for the right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of theſe three verſes, is the circumſtance of time, namely after how much of the Hiſtory of <hi>Adam</hi> muſt theſe three verſes ſucceed, according to the rule of true Chronology.</p>
                  <p>This conſideration is a Rule of great importance to find out the true ſenſe of theſe three verſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> My Anſwer to this Query is this, namely that theſe three verſes muſt in order of time be placed at the end of the third Chapter; As it hath been well obſerved, both by the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors, and by ſundry Chriſtian Writers, as I have noted it in <hi>R.</hi> 1. and p. 1. And ſee alſo Dr. <hi>Leightfoots</hi> Chronolgy for this; and <hi>Samuel T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>rſhel</hi> in his Deſign about diſpoſing the Bible into an Harmony, he doth in p. 10. direct us to place the three firſt verſes of <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 1, 2, 3. at the end of the third Chapter, and ſo doth Mr. <hi>Bro.</hi> alſo.</p>
                  <p>I have alſo noted in Chap. 18. that the only reaſon why <hi>Moſes</hi> doth place theſe three verſes at the beginning of the ſecond Chapter is this; namely, becauſe he had begun to ſet down the ſtory of all the ſix working dayes in <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. therefore he thought it meet to ſet down the ſtory of the ſeventh day in the next place; and ſo he hath placed the brief ſtory of all the ſeven dayes of the week together, that ſo he might take the more liberty afterwards to return again unto the large ſtory of <hi>Adams</hi> Creation, Fall, and Redemption, from the ſeventh verſe of the ſecond Chapter to the end of the third Chapter: All which ſtory fell out upon the ſixth day, and therefore the ordination of the Sabbath, though it be ſet in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 2, 3. yet in the order of Chronology, it muſt be ſet after the third Chapter of <hi>Geneſis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This conſideration may ſerve as a neceſſary Rule to guide us in the right apprehending, and underſtanding of ſundry words in the ſaid three verſes, which elſe cannot be fully and rightly underſtood; for we muſt expound theſe three verſes as if
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:44298:24"/>
they had been placed at the end of the third Chapter.</p>
                  <p>And this is no new device of mans brain, but it is an uſual thing for the Pen-men of the holy Scriptures, to make ſuch like diſlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of Chapters and verſes; and in that reſpect the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors do ſay, that there is no <hi>Order of former and latter in the Law,</hi> for oftentimes the Pen-men of the holy Scriptures do ſet that which is after, Before; and ſo conſequently we muſt by the rule of Chronology place the Inſtitution of the Sabbath after the third Chapter, though <hi>Moſes</hi> for the reaſon aforeſaid, hath ſet it in the beginning of the ſecond Chapter.</p>
                  <p>So then by this rule of direction, I hope it will be eaſie to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern that theſe three verſes muſt be expounded with relation to the ſtory of <hi>Adams</hi> Fall, Re-creation, and Reconciliation by the Promiſed-Seed. And therefore it follows by neceſſary conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, that <hi>Adams</hi> Re-creation by the Seed of the woman, muſt be conſidered as the finiſhing act of the ſix dayes creation, before the ſeventh day was ordained to be a Sabbath.</p>
                  <p>And by this Rule of Expoſition, many words alſo in the ſaid three verſes muſt be ſo expounded, as having a holy equivoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in them, namely, as having a myſticall ſenſe, as well as a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terall.</p>
                  <p>As for example, under this word <hi>Made</hi> and <hi>Created,</hi> muſt be underſtood the myſtical and ſpiritual Creation, as well as the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral and viſible Creation: And under the word Finiſhed muſt be underſtood not only the finiſhing of the viſible Creation, but of the myſticall and ſpirituall Creation alſo; which muſt be fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, I mean ſome of that kind, by the Seed of the woman, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Hoſt of Heaven can be ſaid to be finiſhed (for the Hoſt of the third heavens muſt be finiſhed, as well as the Hoſt of the viſible heavens) before the end of the ſixth day.</p>
                  <p>The like myſtical interpretation I ſhall give of the word Reſted, Bleſſed, &amp;c. when I come at them.</p>
                  <p>In brief, I apprehend that there are ten ſeverall words in the ſaid three verſes that muſt be expounded in a myſtical ſenſe as well as in a literal.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Hence I reaſon thus,</p>
                  <p>If all the ſeveral ſorts and kinds of creatures which apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to the Hoſt of Heaven and Earth were finiſhed before the ſeventh day; then <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> were Re-created before the ſeventh day: for Gods Hoſt was not finiſhed untill ſome of that ſort of creatures were finiſhed, which did appertain to the Hoſt of the Church Militant here upon earth, and to the Hoſt of the Church Triumphant in heaven.</p>
                  <p>But all the ſeverall ſorts and kinds of creatures which apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to the Hoſt of heaven and earth were finiſhed before the ſeventh day, as the text doth plainly ſpeak.</p>
                  <p>Therfore <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> were Re-created before the ſeventh day, and did appertain to the Hoſt of the Church Militant here on earth, and to the Hoſt of the Church Triumphant in heaven be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſeventh day, or elſe God did not finiſh all the Hoſt of heaven and earth before the ſeventh day, which is to deny and contradict the words of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p>It is out of queſtion therfore that the ſouls of <hi>Adam</hi> &amp; <hi>Eve</hi> were Re-created, and made perfect by the Redemption of the Promiſed Seed before the ſeventh day for that ſort of creature doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain to the heavenly Hoſt as well as the Angels, and to Gods ſpiritual Hoſt and Church here upon earth, and in that reſpect the godly converts are called (by the Figure Continent for the for the thing contained) <hi>The new Heavens, and the new Earth, in which dwelieth Righteouſneſſe,</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 13.</p>
                  <p>And it is further evident that ſuch redeemed perſons are a true part of Gods Hoſt here upon earth, becauſe the Scripture calls the

                     <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> therefore muſt not onely fall into the ſpiritual death of ſin, in the day of their creation, but they muſt alſo be Re-created the ſame day, as a principal ſort of thoſe creatures, which God did create and provide, both for his earthly, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo for his heavenly Hoſt; for the Text ſaith, <hi>That the Heavens and the Earth were finiſhed, and all the Hoſt of them:</hi> which muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of every ſeveral ſort of Hoſt, not numerically of the whole number, but ſpecifically of the ſeverall kinds of each Hoſt, for no new thing of a new kind was created after the ſixth day.</p>
                  <p>Therefore ſeeing God did finiſh all the Hoſt of heaven and earth before the ſeventh day, he muſt needs Re-create <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> before the ſeventh day, that ſo they might be a part of his Militant Church, Hoſt, or Army, here upon earth, to maintain an utter enmity againſt Sathan and his ſeed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. and ſo from the firſt ſixth day, and forwards, God will have a Militant Church to continue here upon earth to fight the warfare of Chriſt againſt Sathan and his ſeed to the end of the world.</p>

                  <p n="4">4 After <hi>Adams</hi> fall it pleaſed God ſo to queſtion with <hi>Adam</hi> about his miſerable condition by his Fall, that he made him ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of his miſery; and then it pleaſed God to make his Mercy known to him in the Mediator.

                  <p n="6">6 The very frame of the words in <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.

                  <p>In like ſort, after that Satan by his malicious Head-plot had ruinated, and broken down that glorious Temple-work of Gods Creation, by inticing <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> to eat the forbidden Fruit, then God laid help upon one that was able and faithful to repair it, for in the end of the ſixth day God told the Devil by way of threatning, and <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> by way of Promiſe, That the Seed of the Woman ſhould break this Head-plot of the Devil, by his Mediatorial obedience, when he ſhould make his Soul a propitiatory Sacrifice for his ſin, even at the ſame time when the Devil ſhould peirce him in the foot-ſoals as a ſinful Malefactor; now God could not declare this but by his Sons pre-conſent, contract, and Covenant, upon his undertaking Gods Attonement, or Reconciliation was procured, and the holy Spirit was procured thereby alſo for <hi>Adams</hi> re-creation, and ſo a Healing went up upon the Creation by this faithful Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and bleſſed Mediator Chriſt Jeſus, the ſtrong Rock, whoſe work is perfect, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 4. and in this reſpect the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> calls the Mediator the faithful, Creator, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 19. whoſe work is perfect, but <hi>Peters</hi> Greek (Ctiſtes) is borrowed from the ſeventy, on 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22. &amp; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18. 2. where the <hi>Hebrew</hi> is Rock, and there it is the attribute of the Mediator; and Chriſt told his Apoſtles, that he would build his Church upon that Rock, and that the gates of Hell ſhould not overcome it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 18.</p>
                  <p>Maſter <hi>Perkins</hi> on the Creed, pag. 154. ſaith, God is called the faithful Creator, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 19. becauſe he did not leave his Works of Creation without his faithful care and providence, as Maſons and Carpenters leave their Houſes as ſoon as they are built, without any further care what becomes of them, for God is a faithful Creator, that will not let his Creation go to ruine.</p>
                  <p>Thus we ſee that <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> were twice Created in one day; 1.

Seed, in the end of the ſame day; and this Creation was permanent, becauſe it was a Creation of God in Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 10. and becauſe Chriſt undertook to make all perfect, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God rewarded Chriſt for this his work, for at the ſame time the Lord put the whole Creation in ſubjection under the feet of Chriſt; and when all this was done, then the whole Creation was perfect, and intire, lacking nothing, and therefore Gods reſt on the Seventh Day was a perfect reſt; But if God had kept his reſt on the Seventh day whiles <hi>Adam</hi> had ſtood in his mutable condition, as ſome Expoſitors would have him to do, then Gods reſt (eſpecially on the firſt Sabbath) had ſtood but upon a tick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh and litigious foundation.</p>

                  <p>And for the more ſpeedy effecting of all this, he did by his eternal Counſel and Providence appoint his heavenly Angels, as wel as his terreſtrial Creatures, to attend upon <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> into Paradiſe, for he fore-knew that if he did but give his heavenly Angels charge to attend upon earthly Man, with other earthly Creatures into Paradiſe, that many Legions of them would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe Man in compariſon of themſelves, and would neglect their charge, that ſo in Juſtice God might deprive them of their pure Natural qualities, and then he knew that they would become an envious company againſt the glory of Man, and that they would agree together in one deep Head-plot (altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen to Man) to ſeduce him, and perſwade him to eat of the forbidden Fruit, that ſo they might be brought into the ſame Spiritual death with themſelves; and by this ſpeedy Head-plot of theirs they made account not only to corrupt <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> but alſo to deſtroy the whole Generation of all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
                  <p>But God that was wiſe in Counſel, and wonderful in Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, who worketh all things after the Counſel of his own Wil, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 11. had contrived how to break this Head-plot of the Devil in peeces by the Seed of the Woman; this Divine H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n, both the goodneſs of Juſtice, and the goodneſs of Mercy, by making the Perſon and office of the Mediator better known, and more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired and honoured of fallen Man, than if <hi>Adam</hi> had ſtood ſtill in his innocency.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:44298:30"/>
As ſoon therefore as <hi>Adam</hi> was fallen, God took occaſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to introduce the Mediator into his Prieſtly Office virtually, that ſo he might reconcile and redeem Man, and put him into a better eſtate again than he had by his firſt Creation, and that thereby God might put all the reſt of his Creation under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Chriſt, as the true Lord, and proper Heir of all things, for all things were created for him, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 16. or elſe if he had not reſtrained ſin, and been pre-ordained to bee the Heir of all things, and to be ready at hand to take the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of all upon him at <hi>Adams</hi> Fall, the whole Creation had been inſtantly confounded by a general Rebellion, and by a total Diſorder, which was the main thing that the Devil aimed at in his Head-plot, but it was prevented, becauſe he had ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Chriſt to be the right Heir of all, to undertake the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all at the very inſtant of <hi>Adams</hi> Fall, and ſo his Mercy is over all his Works, as the Hen is over her Chickens, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 145.</p>
                  <p>From the Premiſes I reaſon thus:</p>
                  <p>The whole Creation was made at firſt for that very end for which it now ſerveth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 91.</p>
                  <p>But now all the whole Creation ſerveth to the honour of the Mediator, for God hath laid the Government of the whole Creation upon his Shoulders, <hi>Eſ.</hi> 9. 6, 7. and hath given him dominion over the Works of his hands, and hath put all things under his feet, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8. 6. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 24. to 28. and in that hee hath put all things in ſubjection under him, he left nothing that ſhould not be ſubject to him, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 2. 8.</p>
                  <p>Therefore God had fore-ordained the Mediator, to reſtrain the violence of corrupted Nature, and to take upon him the right of Government, as the right Heir of all things, even from the firſt moment of Mans Fall, for all things were created for him, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 16. and therefore God could not keep a Sabbath of reſt untill he had put the right Heir into actual poſſeſſion, and in that reſpect Chriſt is ſtiled the Lord of all Hoſts, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 24. 10. becauſe all the Hoſts of Heaven and Earth were put under his Dominion, even from the day of Mans creation; and in that reſpect alſo Chriſt is ſtiled and called, The beginning of the creation of God, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 14. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 15. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102. 26. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 10. for hee was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained before all things, and by him all things do conſiſt, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 17. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 10. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 6.</p>

                  <p>Chriſt was as truly made fleſh of the ſeed of the Virgin <hi>Eve</hi> on the ſixth day, as he was made fleſh of the ſeed of <hi>David, Rom.</hi> 1. 3.
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:44298:31"/>
and his fleſh was as truly eaten by faith of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> and of all the godly Fathers that offered Sacrifices of Attonement by faith, as it is eaten by us now; for this Propoſition is general, and belongeth to the godly in all ages from the firſt Promiſe, <hi>That un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ye eat the fleſh of the Son of Man, ye can have no life in you,</hi> Joh. 6. 53. And for the confirmation of this firſt Promiſe (that Chriſt ſhould be made fleſh of the ſeed of the woman) Chriſt did often appear to the Fathers in the ſhape of a man, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 24. <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 31. to aſſure them, that as he was truly exhibited in a gracious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to our firſt Parents, ſo he would in due time take our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon him; and in this reſpect the humane nature of Chriſt was called by the Prophet <hi>Jeremy, A new created thing in the Earth, A Virgin ſhall compaſſe a man,</hi> Jer. 31. 22.</p>
                  <p>This whole Chapter is a Propheſie of the dayes of the Meſſiah (as any conſiderate Reader may eaſily diſcern) I put in the term Virgin, inſtead of our tranſlated term Woman, and yet I find no fault with the term Woman, provided the interpretation be of a Virgin-Woman; but if the term Woman be taken for one that hath a Husband, in that ſenſe I diſlike the term, for it is no new created thing for a woman that hath a husband to compaſſe a man-child in her womb.</p>
                  <p>2 I diſſent from them that think the word Compaſſe doth mean the crafty fetches of an immodeſt woman, ſeeking as an agent to circumvent ſome man or other into the bond of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; This Interpretation cannot ſtand, becauſe this is no new created thing.</p>
                  <p>3 I diſſent from them that make this Woman to be the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the <hi>Jews</hi> that ſhall conquer the great Empire of the <hi>Turks,</hi> for this new device doth not make this new created thing.</p>
                  <p>But to me it is moſt evident that this new created thing is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but the humane nature of Chriſt encompaſſed in the womb of a Virgin; Firſt, of the Virgin <hi>Eve;</hi> And ſecondly, of the Virgin <hi>Mary:</hi> And at this new created thing, no doubt but <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> did as much wonder, as the Angels did at the hanging of the earth upon nothing, <hi>Job</hi> 38. 7. yea this new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thing may juſtly raviſh both Men and Angels with wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as it doth, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 12. <hi>Exod.</hi> 25. 20.</p>
                  <p>By this Viſion the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> did call backſliding <hi>Iſrael</hi> to conſider this new created thing (ſaying, by way of wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:44298:32"/>
at their unbeleef) <hi>How long wilt thou go about, O thou back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliding daughter? for the Lord hath created a new thing in the earth, A Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin-woman ſhall compaſſe a man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence it is evident, that if this backſliding Daughter had but duly conſidered this new created thing, it would have wrought true converſion in them as well as it did in <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve (But who hath beleeved our report,</hi> ſaith the Prophet in the like caſe, <hi>Eſ.</hi> 53. 1. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> would have cured wicked <hi>Ahaz</hi> his unbeleef with this ſign, <hi>Eſ.</hi> 7. 14. but this new created thing did not work admiration in his affections, as it did in <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> and therefore it did him no good.</p>
                  <p>After <hi>Jeremy</hi> had propounded this new created thing for the converſion of back-ſliding <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>I awaked, and behold my ſleep was ſweet unto me,</hi> Jer. 31. 26. it wrought ſweet affections of joy in the conſideration of it; But if <hi>Jeremy</hi> had conceived as ſome Interpreters do, that this woman had been a ſubtill immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt woman, then I marvell how he could have had any ſweet content in that conſideration when he awoke.</p>
                  <p>By this woman therefore I do not only underſtand the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> that did actually compaſſe the Humane nature of Chriſt in her womb, but I do alſo underſtand the Virgin <hi>Eve</hi> that did virtually compaſſe him in her womb by faith, for God did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit the Meſſiah to her in a gracious Propoſition in the cool of the ſixth day while ſhe was a Virgin; And it is remarkable that the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> doth ſpeak of this new created thing both in the time paſt, and alſo in the time to come; <hi>Behold,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the Lord hath created a new thing in the earth</hi> (and in the next clauſe he ſpeaks of it as of a thing to come) <hi>A Virgin ſhall compaſſe a man, or a man-child</hi> (for a man-child is called <hi>A man,</hi> Job 3. 2. Joh. 16. 21.)</p>
                  <p>So then this phraſe, <hi>God had finiſhed his work which he had made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſeventh day,</hi> includes all this that I have ſpoken of the Humane nature of Chriſt, as I have alſo noted it in Chap. 3. R. 2.</p>
                  <p>Alſo the extent of this term <hi>created</hi> and <hi>made</hi> is very large, for it is often applied to things that are new, marvellous, and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, <hi>Eſ.</hi> 65. 18. <hi>Ex.</hi> 34. 10. <hi>Num.</hi> 16. 30. alſo it is applied to Gods powerfull acts, <hi>Deut.</hi> 3. 24. and to things that are done in a mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous manner above nature, <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 9. In all which regards
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:44298:32"/>
the humane nature of Chriſt; (as it was compaſſed in the womb of a Virgin that never knew man) may well be called a glorious, powerful, and miraculous new created thing in the earth to the ſound converſion of a true conſiderate heart.</p>
                  <p>2 This new created thing the Prophet <hi>Agur</hi> doth make to be the greateſt wonder of all the four which he doth name, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare together, in <hi>Prov.</hi> 30. 18, 19.</p>
                  <p>

This <hi>Hebrew</hi> word is never uſed for a polluted Adultreſſe as ſome would have it to mean in this place. 2 Neither is this <hi>Hebrew</hi> word uſed for a maried woman, but alwayes for a Virgin that never knew man: Examine the ſeveral places where this <hi>Hebrew</hi> word is uſed, and that will confirm the truth of my obſervation; It is uſed but ſix times only in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24. 43. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 68. 25. <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 2. <hi>Cant.</hi> 6. 7. <hi>Eſ.</hi> 7. 14. <hi>Prov.</hi> 30. 19. in the firſt five places no queſtion is made by any to the contrary; all the queſtion is about this laſt place in <hi>Prov.</hi> 30. 19. and yet if the ſcope of the Prophet <hi>Agur</hi> in this Chapter be well marked, there is no more queſtion of this place, than of the reſt; for in this Chapter the Prophet <hi>Agur</hi> doth ſpeak of Chriſt in our nature, and calls him <hi>Ithiel</hi> and <hi>

                  <p>Therefore ſeeing the Prophet <hi>Agur</hi> doth ſpeak of Chriſt in our nature in the fore-front of this Propheſie, what lets but that he may ſpeak alſo of his wonderful ſtrange conception in the womb of a Virgin? the wonderfulneſſe whereof he doth illuſtrate by way of compariſon to three other things that are beyond the power of humane reaſon to find out; For firſt, who can find out the path-way where a ſhip hath gone in the middeſt of the Sea? Or ſecondly, the path-way where an Eagle hath flown in the midſt of the air? Or thirdly, the path-way of a Serpent from
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:44298:33"/>
the Rock: Put fourthly, who can find out how a Man-child can be conceived in the womb of a Virgin that never knew man? the Prophet <hi>Agur</hi> makes this fourth thing a greater wonder than the other three. And this laſt the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> calls a new created thing in the earth; and ſeeing all ſorts of creatures were created in ſix dayes, it follows, that this new created thing of the humane nature of Chriſt in the womb of a Virgin, was created and exhibited to fallen <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> in a gracious Propetical Declaration on the ſixth day, before that God could keep a perfect reſt on the ſeventh day.</p>

                  <p n="4">4 The diſtinction of the natural day into Morning and Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was ſo contrived by Gods providence for the Honour of the Mediator, for the glad tydings of his Propitiatory Sacrifice was conſtantly remembred, and typified by the Morning and Evening, Sacrifices; for that diviſion of the day into morning and evening is a differing diviſion from day &amp; night (as I have ſhewed at large in my book of <hi>Holy Time)</hi> and therefore according to the uſual time of the Evening Sacrifice Chriſt performed his Propitiatory Sacrifice of Attonement, about the midſt of the firſt Evening, for the firſt natural Evening begins at Mid-day at the firſt declining of the Sun, and continues till Sun-ſet, where the night begins, and in the midſt of this evening, namely about three a clock in the afternoon, Chriſt made his ſoul an Evening Sacrifice of mans Redemption.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 The ſeveral ſorts of Beaſts and Fowls were made for the Honour of the Mediator; and though ſome of them were by Gods Providence to be of a ravenous kind, namely as ſoon as <hi>Adam</hi> fell, yet they could not deſtroy fallen man from the face of the earth, neither could they wholly deſtroy their fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creatures that were of a tame kind, becauſe the Lord God had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained a Mediator to be the right Heir of them all, and to rule them all (by reſtraining their corrupt deſires, and guiding them) as ſoon as <hi>Adam</hi> fell, ſo that the hungry Lions could not devour <hi>Daniel</hi> without his licenſe; and as for the reſt of the creatures which were ordained to be of a more quiet and harmleſs kind, God called them clean Beaſts, and ſome of them he ordained for the uſe of Sacrifices, as the fitteſt to typifie the innocency of Chriſts humane nature, and the perfection of his Sacrifice.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 All ſorts of creatures were made for the Honor of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator; and therefore as ſoon as <hi>Adam</hi> fell, God put all things in ſubjection under his feet, <hi>And there was nothing that was not made ſubject unto him,</hi> Heb. 2. 8.

                  <p>Yea when the Mediator was here upon earth in his humane nature, all creatures obeyed him as their Lord; for he rebuked the boy ſterous winds, and the raging ſea, and they obeyed him; He commanded the liquid waters to bear him as the dry land, and they obeyed him; He commanded a hundred fifty three great fiſhes to come into <hi>Peters</hi> Net, and not to break it, and they obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 21. He commanded that fiſh that had ſwallowed a Stater to come to <hi>Peters</hi> Angle to pay his tribute, and that obeyed him; He commanded the Aſſe-colt whereon never man ſate to carry him with all gentleneſſe to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as if it had been tamed by former riding, and it obeyed him; He commanded diſeaſes of all ſorts to depart from the ſick, and they obeyed him: Yea he commanded the Devils to come out of certain men and women, and they obeyed him; Yea at the time of <hi>Noahs</hi> flood, He commanded all ſorts of creatures, as well the wild ravenous kind, as the tame kind, to come of their own accord into <hi>Noahs</hi> Ark, and to live quietly together, and they obeyed him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 7. 8, 9. But the wicked world, becauſe they deſpiſed the Spirit of Chriſt in <hi>Noah,</hi> therefore Chriſt commanded a deluge of water to ſeize upon their bodies, and their ſouls he ſent to the priſon of Hell, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 19.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 God gave the Mediator an abſolute Dominion over all Tyrants, ſo that they cannot do as much miſchief to his people as they deſire, <hi>For Chriſt ruleth even in the midſt of his enemies,</hi> Pſal. 110. 2, 5, 6, 7.

And if he had not been declared to be the Son of Man juſt upon <hi>Adams</hi> Fall, the Devill would have made a helliſh confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Creation at that inſtant, but he was prevented by the right Heir that ſtood ready to take the Government of all upon him, as ſoon as ever <hi>Adam</hi> fell.</p>
                  <p>From theſe, and the like conſiderations it is evident, that God created the world for the Honor of the Mediator, and that he might rule it as the right Heir of it; And the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors

                  <p>But God could not be ſaid to keep a perfect reſt from all his Works which he had made, as long as <hi>Adam</hi> ſtood in a mutable condition, for God knew from Eternity that <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> would preſently fall from their Created perfections, through the temptation of Satan, and that thereupon the whole Creation would fall into utter confuſion, and that then God muſt either ſuffer Satan to take the Dominion of the whole Creation, or elſe that he muſt begin again to make it more perfect than it was before, by a new Creation.</p>
                  <p>Seeing therefore that one of theſe two things muſt neceſſarily follow upon <hi>Adams</hi> fall, God could not keep a perfect reſt on the Seventh Day from all his Works, untill he had inſtalled the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator into his Office, and ſetled the whole government of all things upon his ſhoulders, as upon our mighty God and Prince of peace, <hi>Eſ.</hi> 9. 6, 7.</p>

                     <p>From all the Premiſes I conclude, That Gods reſt on the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day, was his ſatisfying delight, and his ſweet content in Chriſt, becauſe he was ordained to be the Seed of the Woman to break the Devills Head-plot by his Propitiatory Sacrifice of Attonement, and becauſe God had ſetled the whole Creation upon the Mediator, whoſe work was ſo perfect that nothing was lacking to the perfection thereof; And therefore it follows, that God ordained the Sabbath, not in the time of <hi>Adams</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, but after his Fall and Re-creation.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Proving, that God bleſſed the firſt ſeventh day with many Spiritual Ordinances, ſuch as were apt to convey Spiritual, and Eternal bleſſedneſſe to faln man.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THis ſentence, <hi>God bleſſed the ſeventh day, and ſanctified it,</hi> Gen. 2. 3. doth contain in it a full deſcription how God did bleſſe the ſeventh day for the good of faln man.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 I will ſpeak of the word <hi>Bleſſed</hi> in this Chapter.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 I will ſpeak of the word <hi>Sanctified</hi> in the next Chapter.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 It is meet to inquire how God did bleſſe the firſt ſeventh day; Did he bleſſe it with any natural bleſſing above the other ſix dayes? Hath he beſtowed a greater bleſſing of fairer weather, or the like, upon that day more than upon any other day in the week? no, but on the contrary he reſtrained his Manna from falling on that day, and beſtowed it upon the <hi>Jews</hi> on all the other ſix dayes of the week.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the bleſſing wherewith God did bleſſe the ſeventh day was not a common natural bleſſing, but doubtleſſe it was a ſpiritual bleſſing in relation to the good of faln man. Hence then
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:44298:38"/>
we may conclude, that God did bleſſe that day with divers ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Ordinances, ſuch as tended to make faln man bleſſed, by opening the manner how the Seed of the Woman ſhould break Sathans Head-plot for mans Redemption.</p>

                     </gap>ction.</p>
                  <p>If there had been no other Argument in all the Scripture to prove that <hi>Adam</hi> ſell, and was Re-created on the ſixth day by the Promiſed Seed, This ſentence, <hi>He bleſſed and ſanctified the ſeventh day,</hi> had been ſufficient to prove it; for God would never have bleſſed the ſeventh day with ſuch ſpiritual Ordinances as he did, nor yet have ſanctified that day for the time of his ſpiritual Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, if the Mediator had not been declared to faln <hi>Adam</hi> before the ſeventh day.</p>
                  <p>And this is further proved by ſome other Scriptures.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 God doth command us faln men in the fourth Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement to remember the Sabbath day to ſanctifie it (and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is added) becauſe in it he reſted from all the works that he had made: And (for that reaſon) Jehovah did bleſſe the ſeventh day, and ſanctifie it, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 9, 10, 11.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaith, <hi>That God did bleſſe the Sabbath day</hi> (namely for the good of faln man) <hi>For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Bleſſed is the man that keepeth the Sabbath, and polluteth it no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>,</hi> Eſ. 56. 2.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Our Saviour doth tell us, that the Sabbath was <hi>made for man,</hi> Mar. 2. 27. namely for the good of man in miſery; but <hi>Adam</hi> in <note place="margin">God did not leave <hi>Adam</hi> &amp; <hi>Eve</hi> to ſpend the ſeventh day in private ſpecul tions, but he bleſſed the firſt 7 day with variety of Ordinances both for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate uſe, for their beſt ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual good.</note> his Innocency was not in miſery, therefore the Sabbath was not then made; but as ſoon as he had eaten of the forbidden fruit he was in miſery, for then his ſoul was dead in ſin, and his body full of corruption, and then the Sabbath was made for man. Hence it follows by neceſſary conſequence, that God did not bleſſe the ſeventh day in <hi>Adams</hi> Innocency, but after his Fall and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 God did not leave <hi>Adam</hi> to himſelf after his Fall and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation, to ſpend the ſeventh day in his own private meditations as he thought beſt, but God bleſſed the ſeventh day with ſeveral publick Ordinances for the good of faln <hi>Adam,</hi> and inſtructed
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:44298:38"/>
him in the right uſe of thoſe Ordinances; if God had left <hi>Adam</hi> to ſpend the Sabbath in his own private ſpeculations as he thought beſt, doubtleſſe his Religion would ſoon have been no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than a Samaritan Religion, for <hi>Adam</hi> by his fall was become ſo corrupt in his affections, and ſo blind in his underſtanding of Gods will, that he would not, nor could not have ſpent the Sabbath to his ſpiritual good.</p>
                  <p>It is a dangerous thing therefore to prefer a mans own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate meditations, and ſpeculations, to publick Ordinances upon the Sabbath; God would not leave <hi>Adam</hi> to ſuch a liberty to do as he thought beſt, ſuch a liberty will ſoon open a wide gap to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans deluſions: But God bleſſed the ſeventh day with his own publick Ordinances, not excluding private meditations; God bleſſed the ſeventh day both with publick and private Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; for publick Ordinances are not ſo much bleſſed as when they are attended with private preparation before, with reverent at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention at, and with carefull rumination and application after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If there be not this care added to the publick Ordinances, the Devill will ſoon ſteal away the ſeed that is ſown, out of our hearts and ſouls.</p>
                  <p>Now the manner how God was pleaſed to inſtruct <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> in the exerciſe of his publick Ordinances, was by the lively Oracles of the Mediator, and therefore doubtleſſe as he was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to be the Seed of the woman, ſo he appeared to <hi>Adam</hi> in his humane ſhape, as he did to <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 32. 24. And in this regard, he is called, <hi>The word of the Father, even from the beginning,</hi> Joh. 1. 1, 2. And the Father gave him a Commandement what to ſay, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. 49, 50. And he it was that did inſtruct all the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; And therefore <hi>Stephen</hi> ſaith, <hi>That he the God of glory appeared to</hi> Abraham <hi>in</hi> Ur <hi>of the Caldes,</hi> Act. 7. 2. and his apparition to <hi>Abraham</hi> was in ſuch a familiar manner, that it did work in him an inward regard and attention to his words, whereby his ſoul was convinced and converted. In ſome ſuch manner did he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> when he did inſtruct them in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his Perſon and Office, and of the uſe of his publick Ordinances wherewith he was pleaſed to bleſſe the ſeventh day.</p>
                  <p>Now the ſeveral Ordinances wherewith God was pleaſed to bleſſe the ſeventh day, I will diſtinguiſh into two ſorts, or ranks.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="62" facs="tcp:44298:39"/>
1 Into ſuch Ordinances as were plain and manifeſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Into ſuch as were Typical and Myſtical.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 I will ſpeak of the plain and manifeſt Ordinances; Theſe were often uſed without the typical, but the typical could not well be uſed without ſome of theſe were added thereto; By theſe plain and manifeſt Ordinances God appointed <hi>Adam</hi> as a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, by the exerciſe of them, to inſtruct himſelf, his wife, and poſterity, by opening the miſery of his fall, and the remedy by the Promiſed Seed.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 The firſt ſort of theſe manifeſt Ordinances, was in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and proclaming his own miſerable condition by his diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence <note place="margin">God comanded <hi>Adam</hi> to preach every ſeventh day either up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able fall, or elſe upon the riches of Gods grace, for his recovery by the Promiſed Seed.</note> in eating of the forbidden fruit; how he had loſt Gods Image by Gods juſt hand of puniſhment, and how he was corrupted in all the parts and powers of his ſoul and body by the poyſonful counſel that Sathan breathed into <hi>Eves</hi> ſoul.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 <hi>Adam</hi> muſt preach, open, and declare to himſelf, and his wife (till they were increaſed in number) the riches of Gods grace for his recovery by the Seed of the Woman, which God had ordained to break the Devils Head-plot for their Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and in opening this, he could not chooſe but open and declare the perſonal union of both the natures of the Mediator, and the excellent dignity of his Office.</p>
                  <p>This bleſſed Doctrine <hi>Adam</hi> was commanded to ſtudy to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain and inlarge (every ſeventh day) in all the branches thereof, and in all the ſeveral benefits thereof to faln man, according to the full extent of Gods Declaration in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. and therefore he muſt open and explain how Chriſt ſhould be the Seed of the Woman, and how he ſhould break the Devils Head-plot by his Prieſtly Office, and by his Propitiatory Sacrifice of Attonement, at the very ſame time when the Devill ſhould endeavour to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it, by putting him to death, and by peircing his foot-ſoals as a ſinfull Malefactor upon the Croſſe; and how he being God as well as man, ſhould deſtroy through death him that had the power of death, that is the Devill, and how he ſhould by that death (which he performed as a Mediatorial Sacrifice) reconcile God to faln man, and ſo procure the Fathers Juſtification from the ſentence of Condemnation, and his favor for their adoption, and for their injoying of his heavenly inheritance.</p>
                  <p>Theſe and ſuch like points as theſe, God inſtructed <hi>Adam</hi>
                     <pb n="63" facs="tcp:44298:39"/>
to ſtudy and to preach to himſelf, wife, and poſterity, in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon, but eſpecially upon every ſeventh day.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 To this neceſſary duty of preaching, whereby God doth <note place="margin">God comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Adam</hi> to joyn the duty of Prayer to the duty of Preaching.</note> ſpeak unto ſinners, <hi>Adam</hi> was commanded to joyn the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary duty of Prayer and ſupplication, whereby ſinners do ſpeak unto God, and he muſt branch out this duty of Prayer into all the ſeveral parts of it, as,</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Into Confeſſion of his miſerable condition by his ſin and diſobedience, and of the ſinful corruption of our nature, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with our daily actual rebellions, for the deeper abaſing of our natural Pride, and ſelf-conceited righteouſneſs.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Into Petition for ſeveral graces of Sanctification, but eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the inward teſtimony of our Reconciliation and Adoption.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Deprecation of evil, according to that Petition, <hi>Lead us not into temptation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4 Thankſgiving for all favours received, but eſpecially for thoſe Spiritual favours by the promiſed ſeed.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 Singing of Pſalms alſo muſt be added (ſometimes at leaſt) as an act of Spiritual joy for Gods manifold ſavours, but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally for that Grand Mercy of our Reconciliation, procured by the Mediators propitiatory ſacrifice of attonement; for by that means the Devils Head-plot is broken, and fallen Man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed, and ſet free from the power of Satan.</p>
                  <p>Theſe ſeveral ſorts of Ordinances I call by the name of plain and manifeſt Ordinances, becauſe they often were and might be uſed without any addition of Typical ſacrifices, or ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of cleaneſs.</p>
                  <p>And this is evident by Gods Command afterwards to the <note place="margin">See my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Jews</hi> Synagogues or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der on this text.</note> Church of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 23. 3. The ſeventh day ſhall be a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath of Sabbatiſm, a Convocation of Holineſs; it ſhall be a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath to Jehovah in all your dwellings.</p>
                  <p>This ſentence [in All your dwellings] proves that God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to obſerve the Sabbath, not only at the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle where Sacrifices muſt be only offered, but it muſt be kept in all their dwellings where no Sacrifices might be offered, and yet by dwellings we muſt not underſtand every mans private Tent, for God commands a Convocation of Holineſs, and a Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation agrees not to every mans private Tent; therefore the meaning of theſe words, <hi>A Convocation in all your dwellings</hi> means
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:44298:40"/>
a Convocation of Holineſs in all their ſeveral Synagogues, which were to be conveniently placed in or among all their dwellings, both during the time of their abode in the Wilderneſs, and alſo where-ever they dwelt afterwards.</p>
                  <p>This commanded convocation was not given to the <hi>Jews</hi> in regard of their Feſtival Sabbaths, which were obſerved with the ſolemnity of Sacrifices, and other rites of Holineſs, for their Feſtival Sabbaths were commanded to be obſerved only in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> at the particular place that God ſhould chuſe to place his Tabernacle or Temple in, after they ſhould be ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in reſt therein; and indeed they could not obſerve their feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val Sabbaths in the Wilderneſs, neither could they every ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day offer Sacrifices in the Wilderneſs, for during the time of their travels in the Wilderneſs the Holy things were folded up.</p>
                  <p>But yet notwithſtanding their travels in the Wilderneſs, they were commanded to obſerve every ſeventh day with a convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of holineſs, in or among all their dwellings, namely in their ſeveral Synagogues, which muſt be placed for their beſt conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency in or among all their dwellings.</p>
                  <p>And it is evident, that the <hi>Jews</hi> did obſerve the Sabbath with Holy convocations in all their Synagogues, becauſe our Saviour did uſually preach every ſeventh day in their Synagogues, either in <hi>Galile,</hi> or in <hi>Judea,</hi> where none of <hi>Aarons</hi> Ceremonies had any uſe at all.</p>
                  <p>By this command of God to the <hi>Jews,</hi> it is manifeſt, That God commanded <hi>Adam</hi> to obſerve every ſeventh day with his plain and manifeſt Ordinances, and doubtleſſe oftentimes alſo with his Typiral and Myſtical Ordinances, which at the firſt were not tied to one ſpecial place.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 The ſecond ſort of Gods publick Ordinances were Typical, and Myſtical, the chiefeſt of all this kind of Worſhip was by propitiatory Sacrifices, or Sacrifices of Attonement, which were of ſeveral ſorts.</p>

                  </list>
                  <p>All theſe ſeveral ſorts of Sacrifices did typifie and repreſent the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:44298:40" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Mediators Propitiatory Sacrifice of Attonement, by which he procured the Fathers Attonement for faln mans Reconciliation, Juſtification, and Adoption, and ſo conſequently for mans Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption from Sathans Head-plot.</p>
                  <p>This bleſſed Doctrine of Salvation, Chriſt repreſented to <hi>Adams</hi> faith in the very firſt ſeventh day, by cauſing <hi>Adam</hi> as a Prieſt to ſacrifice ſome Lamb, or ſome ſuch like beaſt, and then doubtleſſe he ſaid unto him, <hi>Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the ſin of the world,</hi> Joh. 1. 29. for Chriſt was typically ſlain from the beginning of the world, <hi>Rev.</hi> 8. 13.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Adam</hi> of himſelf could not tell how to offer ſacrifice, and <note place="margin">Chriſt Jeſus taught <hi>Adam</hi> by the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a Lamb how he ſhould be the Lamb of God to take away the ſin of the world.</note> therefore doubtleſſe Jeſus Chriſt appeared to him in the ſhape of his humane nature, and did inſtruct him by a lively Oracle, what the Office of a Prieſt was, and how to build an Altar of earth (for that kind of Altar was firſt in uſe, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 24.) and that all thoſe places where ſuch Altars were builded, were holy places, as long as ſuch places were in uſe for ſacrifice, and therefore Chriſt Jeſus did uſually ſanctifie ſuch places, either by his glorious apparition, or by fire from heaven to conſume the Sacrifice, or by both.</p>
                  <p>The Altar was holy in another reſpect, namely becauſe it was ordained to be a type of the God-head of Chriſt, whereon he would one day offer his humane nature, as a ſacrifice of Attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Exod.</hi> 29. 37. <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 19. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14.</p>
                  <p>And doubtleſſe Chriſt Jeſus did kindle <hi>Adams</hi> ſacrifice at firſt with fire from heaven, for he did uſually kindle the ſacrifices of the Fathers with fire from Heaven, as a ſign and token to them, that his death was a propitiatory ſacrifice of Attonement, and that their perſons were thereby received into full favour, <hi>Lev.</hi> 9. 23. <hi>Judg.</hi> 13. 19, 20, 23. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 18. 38, 39. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7. 1, 2, 3. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 20. 3.</p>
                  <p>And doubtleſſe Chriſt Jeſus told <hi>Adam</hi> that this fire from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven did repreſent his Eternal Spirit, by which his humane nature ſhould one day be offered up unto God without ſpot, as a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiatory ſacrifice for his eternal Redemption, <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>.</hi> 9 14.</p>
                  <p>But afterwards when <hi>Cain</hi> came to offer his ſacrifice upon the ſame Altar, Chriſt Jeſus did not kindle his ſacrifice from heaven as he kindled <hi>Adams</hi> and <hi>Abels</hi> ſacrifice; and by that <hi>Cain</hi> knew that God did not accept his perſon, as he did his brother <hi>Abel,</hi>
                     <pb n="66" facs="tcp:44298:41"/>
and thereupon he hated his brother <hi>Abel,</hi> becauſe his works were good, and his own evill, for <hi>Cain</hi> wanted faith in the Seed of the woman, which was promiſed to break the Devils Head-plot by his propitiatory ſacrifice, which was taught, and typified by ſacrifices: This myſtery God kept ſecret in types from ſuch as wanted faith, even from the beginning of the world, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 25. and therefore it was kept ſecret from the Heathen Nations: But in the fulneſſe of time Chriſt Jeſus ſent his Apoſtles to publiſh the unſearchable riches of this myſtery, which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God who created all things by Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3 8 9. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 26. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 3.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 God inſtructed <hi>Adam</hi> in ſundry other kinds of Ceremonial types that tended to ſanctification, before he came to preſent his perſon and ſacrifice before the Lord. As for example, Chriſt Jeſus taught him, 1 How to purifie his perſon by waſhing his body, and his garments, in clean water, juſt like as he taught <hi>Moſes</hi> afterwards, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3. 5. <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. 10. or elſe by changing his ſoul garments for fair, as <hi>Jacob</hi> being firſt taught, did alſo teach his houſ-hold to do, when he went into Gods preſence to worſhip, <hi>Gen.</hi> 35. 2.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 God inſtructed <hi>Adam</hi> how to put a difference between beaſts for ſacrifice, how he ſhould refuſe the unclean, and offer the clean, juſt as he inſtructed <hi>Noah</hi> before he entred into the Ark, <hi>Gen.</hi> 7. 2.</p>
                  <p>It is abſurd to think that God did bleſſe the firſt Sabbath with differing Ordinances from thoſe in <hi>Moſes,</hi> or that God did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct <hi>Adam</hi> to worſhip him in a differing way from that which he did after eſtabliſh by <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets.

And then grew prophaneſſe inſtead of calling upon the name of Lord, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 26.

Hence it is manifeſt, that thoſe that regard the Sabbath, and the Sabbath Ordinances, ſhall be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with ſpiritual bleſſings in heavenly things; And if God bleſſe, who ſhall curſe? for his bleſſing maketh rich, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10. 22. it makes them rich with temporal bleſſings that diligently attend upon their Civil imployments, and ſo it alſo maketh them rich with ſpiritual bleſſings that diligently attend upon Gods Sabbath Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances; Gods bleſſing did increaſe the Widows oyl, and the five loaves, and two fiſhes; and therefore his bleſſing is called <hi>Multiplication,</hi> Gen. 1. 22. and ſometimes it is called <hi>A rich reward,</hi> 2 King. 5. 15. and ſometimes it is called <hi>(Gods) Liberality,</hi> Prov. 11. 25. compared with 2 Cor. 9. 5. Yea Gods bleſſing is ſo plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull, and ſo powerfull upon his Sabbath Ordinances, that he is ſaid to <hi>Command his bleſſing upon Sion, and life for evermore,</hi> Pſal. 133. therefore his bleſſing wherewith he bleſſed the firſt ſeventh day muſt needs be mighty in operation, even to the Re-creation and Converſion of many ten thouſand ſouls, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 12. <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 28. and therefore <hi>David</hi> doth by way of Exclamation cry out, <hi>O bleſſed are they that dwell in thy houſe,</hi> Pſal. 84. 4. namely they are thus bleſſed that do as it were dwell there by their frequent and conſtant reſort to his Ordinances, for his Ordinances are apt to convey bleſſings to the diligent ſoul. And therefore <hi>Paul</hi> told the <hi>Romans,</hi> that when he ſhould come unto them, <hi>He ſhould come with</hi>

                  <p>And therefore as ſoon as Chriſt Jeſus had given order about his Sabbath-Worſhip at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and had in ſpecial com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to obſerve the ſeventh day, by a holy convocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in or among all their dwellings (namely in their Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues, as I have afore expounded it) then he made a gracious promiſe to his people, ſaying, <hi>In all places where I ſhall record my name, I will come unto thee, and bleſſe thee,</hi> Exod. 20. 24. and in this reſpect Chriſt Jeſus did appoint the Prieſts in the Sanctuary, and <hi>Zeliach Tzibbur</hi> in the ſeveral Synagogues to pronounce a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous bleſſing upon the aſſembly (that had attended Gods Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces) at their departure, <hi>Numb.</hi> 6. 24. and to this bleſſing the Lord was alſo pleaſed to adde a gracious promiſe, in verſ. 27. ſaying, <hi>They ſhall put my name upon the Sons of Iſrael, and I will bleſſe</hi>

                  <p>Hitherto I have ſpoken of Gods bleſſing the ſeventh day with publick Ordinances; now I ſhall ſpeak ſomething of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Ordinances, where-with God hath alſo bleſſed the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day.</p>
                  <p>Gods bleſſing of the Sabbath, is his bleſſing at large, even his <note place="margin">Private duties are command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath dayes, as neceſſary handmaids to the publick.</note> bleſſing upon the whole day, he bleſſed the ſeventh day with as large a bleſſing as may be, namely, not onely with publick, but alſo with private Ordinances, and therefore he ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the whole day to his ſervice, he did not ſanctifie that part onely wherein his publick Ordinances were diſpenced, but the whole day, and therefore the whole day muſt be ſet a part to his ſervice; and therefore when the publick Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are ended, private duties muſt take place, that the whole day may be bleſſed to our ſouls, and ſanctified to the Lords ſervice.</p>
                  <p>Let no man therefore miſtake me, for though I do not make private duties to be commanded in the firſt place, yet I beleeve that private duties are commanded, and bleſſed of God, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary handmaids to the publick, and there are good reaſons for it.</p>

                  <p>From theſe, and ſuch like inſtances, it follows, That when God ſanctified the firſt ſeventh day, he commanded <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> (for the more ſolemnity) to prepare themſelves for the ſanctifying of the ſeventh day; God having made a promiſe to them in the end of the ſixth day, that the Seed of the Woman ſhould break the head of the Serpent, he ſanctified the next day for a Sabbath of reſt, becauſe he had bleſſed it with Ordinances, and thereby he did command <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> to prepare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt they came into his holy preſence on the morrow, for ſin had defiled them, and therefore they needed to prepare themſelves, not onely by outward waſhing, but alſo inwardly by true repentance, <hi>Act.</hi> 22. 16. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 15. <hi>Eſ.</hi> 29. 23. or elſe inſtead of receiving good by that bleſſing wherewith God had bleſſed the ſeventh day, they might expect a curſe, at leaſt an outward curſe upon their bodies, as it fell out upon <hi>Aarons</hi> Sons, when they did not ſanctifie the Lord in his worſhip according to his command, the Lord ſtruck them with preſent death, ſaying, <hi>I will be ſanctified in all that come neer me,</hi> Lev. 10. 3. and when ſome of <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Manaſſes</hi> did come to the ſanctified Paſſeover in the dayes of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> God was diſpleaſed with them, becauſe they had not prepared themſelves thereto according to the ſanctified, or commanded preparation of the Sanctuary; but <hi>Hezekiah</hi> prayed for them, and the Lord heard him, and healed the people, 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 30, 18, 19, 20.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 I will ſpeak a little more of the word <hi>Sanctified,</hi> as it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies a command to fallen man to prepare himſelf to ſanctify the ſeventh day, for all ſanctified things muſt be remembred by way of preparation before hand, that ſo they may be done in due time and order, or elſe God that is jealous of his ſanctified things, will be diſpleaſed.</p>
                  <p>And therefore one Reaſon why the word <hi>Remember</hi> was after added to the fourth Commadement was (not to adde a new ſenſe to that Command more than it had to <hi>Adam</hi> under the word <hi>Sanctified)</hi> but to increaſe the charge of preparation, with more vehemency, which at the firſt was couched under the word
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:44298:46"/>
                     <hi>Sanctified;</hi> for now the people of God had forgotten the charge that was contained in the word <hi>Sanctified;</hi> and therefore when Jeſus Chriſt did give the fourth Commandement at Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> by the Miniſtery of <hi>Moſes,</hi> he added the word <hi>Remember,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Remember the Sabbath day to ſanctifie it,</hi> Exod. 20. 8. for about three <note place="margin">Exod. 20. 8.</note> weeks before this (as the time may be calculated by comparing <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. 1. with <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. 1.)

                     <note place="margin">Exod. 16. 23.</note> 
                     <hi>Lord,</hi> Exod. 16. 23. Chriſt Jeſus did not now ſpeak theſe words to them by way of a firſt Inſtitution of the Sabbath, but by way of admonition to prepare themſelves to obſerve it as a holy or ſanctified day already commanded; for how elſe did the ſeventh day come to be now called the Holy Sabbath, but by a former command? for every holy thing is firſt commanded of God; and therefore that they might the better remember the holy Sabbath to ſanctifie it, Chriſt Jeſus reſtrained the falling of Manna, ſo that there was no Manna rained upon that day, as there was upon all the other ſix dayes; by which wonder God did charge the people to remember the Sabbath day, and to prepare themſelves for it by preparing the food of the Sabbath on the ſixth day; and yet for all this, it came to paſſe, that there went out ſome of the people to gather (Manna) and they found none; thereupon the Lord Jeſus ſaid thus unto <hi>Moſes, How long refuſe you to keep my Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and my Laws,</hi> Exod. 16. 27, 28. Hence it is evident, that Jeſus Chriſt had made a Law for the keeping of the Sabbath, before he <note place="margin">Exod. 16. 27, 28.</note> gave the fourth Commandment at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and no other time for that Command can be found in all the Scripture, but <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 3. and there it is couched under the word <hi>Sanctified,</hi> therefore when God did ſanctifie the firſt ſeventh day, he did under that word, not onely command <hi>Adam</hi> to ſanctifie the ſeventh day, but under that word he did alſo command him to prepare himſelf to ſanctifie it, for that word contains as much, as if he had ſaid to <hi>Adam,</hi> Remember to ſanctifie it by the practiſe of ſuch publick and private Ordinances, as I have bleſſed the ſeventh day withall, for thy good, and prepare thy ſelf thereto with all carefulneſſe.</p>
                  <p>From all theſe conſiderations it is evident, that Jeſus Chriſt hath ever been uniform in his command touching the ſanctified uſe of the ſeventh day, even from the very firſt inſtitution of it, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 3. untill he had finiſhed the typical reſt of it by his

                        <hi>Shewing how God ſanctified the outward Reſt of the ſeventh Day to be a typical ſign, both of his own Reſt, and of mans Reſt in the Seed of the Woman for the breaking of the Devils Head-plot for mans Redemption.</hi>

                  </argument>
                  <p>GOd did not ſanctifie the outward reſt of the ſeventh day as a typical ſign of his Reſting from the labour of his viſible Creation, as I have elſewhere noted.</p>
                  <p>But God Reſted the ſeventh day, and ſanctified that day of Reſt, becauſe his ſoul did now reſt upon the Rock Chriſt, who had undertaken mans Re-creation, and the government of the whole Creation in oppoſition to Sathans Head-plot, then Gods Soul reſted on the ſeventh day, and was refreſhed: If God had reſted on the ſeventh day whiles <hi>Adam</hi> ſtood in a mutable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eſt had been but an imperfect and uncertain reſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of <hi>Adams</hi> ſpeedy fall, God did not therefore reſt, nor ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie that reſt as a typical ſign of his reſt, and of mans reſt in the Seed
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:44298:47"/>
of the Woman, till after <hi>Adams</hi> Fall and Re-creation, as I have noted formerly.</p>
                  <p>And it is evident, that God did not ordain the holy Reſt of the ſeventh day, nor any other thing to be a ſanctified ſign of his grace in Chriſt, as long as any of thoſe things did lack any thing to the perfection thereof. As for example.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 When God ſanctified the Tabernacle as a type of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature of Chriſt, he did not ſanctifie it, that is to ſay, he did not command it to be ſanctified as long as it lacked any thing to the perfection thereof, but as ſoon as it had its perfection of being finiſhed and reared up, he ſanctified it, <hi>Num.</hi> 7. 1.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 They did not ſanctifie the Altar untill it was finiſhed and made perfect, neither might they offer any offering upon the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar after it was made, untill it was ſanctified by the holy anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing oyl, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 God did not ſanctifie <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons, as a type of the Prieſtly Perſon of Chriſt, untill they had compleatly fulfilled all the typical Ceremonies that did appertain to their Prieſtly Office, <hi>Ex.</hi> 28. 3. 41. <hi>Ex.</hi> 29. 1. 9. <hi>Lev.</hi> 8. 10.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 God did not ſanctifie the firſt-born of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to his ſervice, untill he had perfectly redeemed them from the deſtruction that fell upon all the Firſt-born of Egypt, <hi>Num.</hi> 8. 17. but then after they were perfectly delivered, he commanded <hi>Moſes</hi> to ſpeak to all <hi>Iſrael</hi> to ſanctifie them to the Lord, <hi>Exod.</hi> 13. 2. namely, after a new Moon had gone over them, for untill a new Moon had gone over them, they lacked of the time that God had appointed for their redemption, and then their price was given to the Lord, <hi>Lev.</hi> 27. 6.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 God did not command the Holy City to be ſanctified un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the wall was finiſhed, and the doors thereof ſet up, but as ſoon as all this was finiſhed, and perfected, then it was ſanctified, and the Dedication thereof kept with great joy, <hi>Neh.</hi> 3. 1. with <hi>Neh.</hi> 12. 27. &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Now from theſe, and ſuch like Inſtances, It follows, that God, could not be ſaid to ſanctifie the outward reſt of the ſeventh day to be a typical ſign of his Reſt, and of mans Reſt in the Mediator, as long as <hi>Adam</hi> ſtood in a mutable, or unconfirmed condition: But as ſoon as God had perfected his Creation by a Re-creation, and had eſtabliſhed the Government of all
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:44298:48"/>
upon the Rock Chriſt, whoſe work is perfect, then God bleſſed and ſanctified the ſeventh day, becauſe in it he had reſted from all his Work which God had created and made.</p>
                  <p>But I ſhall yet a little further endeavour to make this point more evident, namely, that the ſanctified reſt of the ſeventh day was ordained to be as a ſanctified ſign of fallen mans reſting on the promiſed ſeed by faith, for the breaking of the Devils Head-plot for Mans redemption, and ſo conſequently as a ſign of mans eternal reſt in Heaven hereafter.</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, that the true ground and reaſon of Gods reſt, and of his commanding man to reſt, in both places is alike, there is no difference at all if the true ſenſe of both places bee rightly underſtood; for God reſted not from the works of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation <note place="margin">Our Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans Head-plot was the laſt fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing act of the whole Creation, therefore i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

command, why man ſhould keep a holy reſt on that day, as it is alſo typified by the Redemption from <hi>Aegypt,</hi> as in <hi>Deut.</hi> 5. 15.</p>
                  <p>Hence it follows by neceſſary conſequence, that God ordained the ſanctified reſt of the ſeventh day to be a typicall ſign unto fallen Man of his reſting upon Chriſt by faith, to break the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils Head-plot, for his Redemption, by his propitiatory ſacrifice in the fulneſſe of time, and then upon the performance thereof the typical uſe of the reſt of the ſeventh day muſt ceaſe, and yet ſuch a way muſt be found out by the Wiſdom of God, as that the ſeventh part of time according to the account of the days of the Week muſt not ceaſe, but it muſt ſtill be preſerved for the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of Gods publick Worſhip: for ſeeing it hath pleaſed God to continue his plain and manifeſt Worſhip ſtill to the end of the world, it hath pleaſed him alſo to continue the ſeventh day for the exerciſe of his publick Worſhip to the end of the world; and no other way can be found out to accompliſh both theſe, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ceaſing of the ſeventh day as it was a typicall ſign, and the continuance of the ſeventh day without any intermiſſion, as it is the ſanctified time of Gods publick Worſhip, but by chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſeventh day into the firſt day of the Week, as I ſhall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after ſhew more at large God willing.</p>
                  <p>And this anſwer to the aboveſaid Objection is the rather to be credited, becauſe the Redemption from <hi>Aegypt</hi> by the typical blood of the Lamb, is alleged by Chriſt as the general reaſón to inforce his people to the obſervation of all the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for the Angel of the Covenant ſaith thus in <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 2. <hi>I</hi>

                  <p>Yea, God was ſo jealous for the holy reſt of his Sabbath, that he would not permit them to do any work at all about the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting of the work of the Tabernacle, though he had comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that work to be done with all diligence, <hi>Exod.</hi> 31. 13. as the place of his holy preſence and reſidence among his people, <hi>Exod.</hi>

                     <p>It follows from all the Premiſes, that God ſanctified the reſt of the ſeventh day, not onely as the ſanctified time of Gods worſhip, both in publick, and in private, but alſo as a ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified ſign of Gods reſting, and of mans reſting on the Seed of the Woman for the breaking of the Devils Head-plot by his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiatory Sacrifice of Attonement, which he ſhould accompliſh at the very ſame time when the Devill by his inſtruments ſhould peirce him in the foot-ſoals; and therefore as ſoon as the Seed of the Woman had finiſhed that ſacrifice, the Holy-reſt of the ſeventh day ceaſed (as well as all the other types of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 7.) namely, ſo far forth as it was a typical ſign of the ſaid reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Seed of the Woman: But yet ſtill, as the ſeventh day was the ſanctified time of Gods worſhip, ſo it muſt ſtill continue for the exerciſe of thoſe Spiritual Ordinances, wherewith God hath bleſſed the ſeventh day for the uſe of all Nations to the end of the world, and becauſe there muſt not be any intermiſſion of the ſeventh part of time according to the dayes of the week, therefore the ſeventh day could not be changed to any other day than the firſt day of the week wherein the Seed of the Woman aroſe from the dead as an abſolute Lord and Conqueror of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans Head-plot.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, His Prophecy that God would deſtroy the wicked World by a Floud, is briefly, and yet plainly enough declared in the name which he gave to his Son at his birth, for he called him, <hi>Meth-u-ſhelach,</hi> which in Engliſh ſounds thus; <hi>Meth</hi> hee dyeth (or when this Childe dyeth) <hi>[U]</hi> then, <hi>Shelah</hi> he ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, or, God ſendeth; and what elſe did God ſend but the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment threatned upon all men in general (as I noted above) and what judgement was that, but the floud?</p>

                  <p>I Have already ſhewed you, that God bleſſed the ſeventh day and ſanctified it, becauſe that in it he reſted from all his works that belonged either to the heavenly or the earthly Hoſt, and that his finiſhing Act lay in this, namely, in ordaining the Seed of the Woman to break the Devils Head-plot, and when that Head-plot was broken then God reſted, and was refreſhed, and then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo he ſanctified the outward reſt of the ſeventh day, to be a ſign both of Gods reſt, and of Mans reſt on the Seed of the Woman; as ſoon therefore as the Seed of the Woman had broken the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils Head-plot, by his propitiatory ſacrifice of Attonement, the holy reſt of the ſeventh day muſt ceaſe, as it was a type or ſign of that which is now performed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="95" facs="tcp:44298:55"/>
But yet withall I pray remember what I have ſaid upon the word <hi>Sanctified,</hi> namely, that thereby God commanded fallen Man to ſet apart the ſeventh day for a double uſe; 1. As the ſanctified time of that Worſhip wherewith he had bleſſed the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day; and, 2. As a ſanctified ſign; in this laſt reſpect the ſeventh day is aboliſhed by the death of Chriſt; but in the firſt reſpect, namely as it was ſet apart for ſo much time to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the exerciſe of ſuch Ordinances both publick and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, as God had bleſſed the ſeventh day withall, ſo it muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, namely, the ſeventh part of time according to the days of the Week, in a conſtant ſucceſſion to the firſt ſeventh day to the end of the world.</p>
                  <p>And indeed the ſeventh part of time cannot bee tranſlated to any other day of the Week, but to the next day after the ſeventh day; for if it had been tranſlated to any other day, God ſhould have been a loſer of his ſeventh part of ſanctified time, there would have been a <hi>vacuum</hi> in the revolution of the ſeventh part of time, at leaſt in the firſt tranſlation of it to any other day but the firſt day of the Week, and ſo the roundneſſe of the ſeventh part of time would have been ſpoiled, which muſt no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Therefore it would have been a great diſhonour to Chriſt, who is made of God to be both the Lord of his Church, and the Lord of the Sabbath, if he had left the day of his publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip arbitrary to each particular Church, to transferre it to what day they pleaſed; A man may with as good reaſon affirm, That Chriſt hath left the outward Form of his publick Worſhip arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to each particular Church, as affirm, That he hath left the day of his publick Worſhip arbitrary; there is as much reaſon for the one as for the other; for Jeſus Chriſt by his death hath made as much alteration in the ſecond Commandement, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of his outward Worſhip, as in the fourth Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in reſpect of the change of the day.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the very order of the Ten Commandements doth plainly tell us, that all Gods publick Worſhip (which is fully comprehended in the ſecond Commandement) muſt have a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick day appointed by God himſelf, for the conſtant exerciſe of his ſaid publick Worſhip; and conſequently it follows, that as
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:44298:56"/>
ſoon as Chriſt had aboliſhed the ſeventh day by his death, he being the Lord of his Church, and the Lord of the Sabbath, muſt eſtabliſh another certain day in the place of the ſeventh day to the end of the world, without any intermiſſion or loſſe of time.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The order of the four Commandements of the firſt Table, lyes thus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1 The firſt Commandement doth injoyn us to worſhip the true God alone, in Unity and Trinity, with the whole inward man.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 The ſecond Commandement doth injoyn us to worſhip the true God with all ſuch outward worſhip as he had commanded at that preſent, or ſhould command afterwards.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 The third Commandement doth injoyn us to worſhip God in a holy manner, both publickly and privately, and with out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward reverence, as well as inward.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 The fourth Commandement doth injoyn us to obſerve the ſeventh day, not onely as a ſanctified ſign, but alſo as the ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied time of that worſhip wherewith God had bleſſed the ſeventh day; as ſoon therefore as Chriſt the Seed of the Woman had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed that work of breaking the Devills Head-plot, by his Propitiatory Sacrifice, the ſeventh day, in regard it was a ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified ſign, muſt ceaſe; but as it was the ſanctified time of Gods publick worſhip, ſo it muſt not ceaſe, but it muſt ſtill be continued, or elſe Gods publick worſhip muſt ſuffer loſſe and confuſion, no other way can be found out, by which the conſtant ſolemnity of Gods eſtabliſhed worſhip may be continued, but by tranſlating the ſeventh day to the next day; for by that means onely, God ſhall ſtill have the ſeventh part of time for his publick worſhip, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out interruption; and by this means onely the twofold manner of ſanctifying the ſeventh day, doth attain its ſeverall ends.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Let it be a little further inquired into, To what end did God command all his publick worſhip in the ſecond Command? and to what end did he command all his publick worſhip to be reverently performed in the third Command, if the day of his publick worſhip in the fourth Command be wholly obliturated?</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Conſider, that the command of Chriſt is that all his publick worſhip muſt be done decently and in order, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. and ſeeing he doth require that the meaneſt circumſtances of his worſhip be done decently and in order, no doubt but he hath taken order that the main things of his publick worſhip ſhould be done de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:44298:56"/>
and in order, and that cannot be without ſome publick day be uniform. But if Chriſt Jeſus hath left the day of his publick worſhip abitrary to his particular Churches, they will hardly agree upon a way of decency, eſpecially in reſpect of the ſolemnity of time, doubtleſſe they will appoint ſeveral dayes of the week as every Church ſhall think beſt for their own conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies; yea it may be that ſome particular Churches may grow ſo corrupt, that they may think one day in a month ſufficient, and others may think one day in two or three months ſufficient for Gods publick worſhip; and who can prevent ſuch diſorders as theſe, if Jeſus Chriſt hath not eſtabliſhed a ſtanding day?</p>
                  <p>There are ſome that profeſſe Chriſtianity that think that Jeſus Chriſt hath not eſtabliſhed a certain publick day in place of the ſeventh day; and therefore they do ſtill hold the Jewiſh Sabbath, together with the Lords day; As for example, The <hi>Melchites</hi> or <hi>Syrians</hi> (who are eſteemed for number to be the greateſt Sect of Chriſtians in the Orient) theſe do confound the day of Gods publick worſhip; for they, and the <hi>Maronites</hi> their neighbours, do obſerve the Jewiſh Sabbath, as ſolemnly as the Lords day. See <hi>Brerewood</hi> in his <hi>Inquiries,</hi> p. 129.</p>
                  <p>And the <hi>Habbiſſines</hi> of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> who are another large Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of Chriſtians, they alſo do reverence the Jewiſh Sabbath equal to the Lords day. See <hi>Brerewood,</hi> p. 155. But bleſſed be God that hath given the Churches of <hi>Europe</hi> a cleerer under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of his will touching the day of his publick worſhip, and yet notwithſtanding, it is alſo much to be lamented, that ſome Chriſtians do not onely hold the ſeventh day to be aboliſhed, but alſo that Chriſt Jeſus hath not eſtabliſhed any publick day in the place of the old.</p>
                  <p>But let me reaſon a little further, Can any man that is well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the order of the Commandements of the firſt Table, think that Chriſt (who bleſſed the ſeventh day with ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Ordinances for the good of faln man, and that ſanctified that day for the exerciſe of the ſaid Ordinances) ſhould now obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turate that Commandement, and ſanctifie no day at all for the exerciſe of his ſaid Ordinances? Can any man think that Chriſt ſhould now after his death, be ſo far unlike to his firſt pattern? Surely me thinks none ſhould be ſo inconſiderate. The holy Reſt of the ſeventh day as it was a typical ſign, ſo I
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:44298:57"/>
grant it to be aboliſhed, but not without any other in the place of it, but by way of exchange for the next day; And this the bleſſed Martyr <hi>Stephen</hi> doth explain to be the truth; for when he was accuſed for affirming that Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> ſhould deſtroy the holy place, and change the Cuſtomes that <hi>Moſes</hi> had delivered unto them, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. 14. his falſe witneſſes did affirm this word <note place="margin">Act 6. 14.</note> Change againſt <hi>Stephen,</hi> as if it had been an odious hereſie to ſay ſo; but how doth <hi>Stephen</hi> anſwer to this Accuſation? Doth he deny it? No, he doth acknowledge it to be a truth in it ſelf, and therefore in his Oration to the High <hi>Synedrion,</hi> he doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm this to be a truth, by ſaying thus to them; <hi>Solomon built him a houſe, Howbeit the moſt High dwelleth not in Temples made with hands, as ſaith the Prophet</hi> (in <hi>Eſ.</hi> 66. 1.) <hi>What houſe will ye build for me, ſaith the Lord, or what place is it that I ſhould reſt in, Hath not my hand made all theſe things?</hi> Act. 7. 47. to 50. with theſe words <hi>Stephen</hi> doth conclude his Oration. In theſe words he doth reprove the High <note place="margin">Act. 7. 47.</note> 
                     <hi>Synedrion,</hi> becauſe of their obſtinate oppoſing the former Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; for his Doctrine tended to prove that God would not reſt locally in a Temple made with mans hands, and ſo conſequently, not in any other outward ſigns, implying, that God would onely reſt in Chriſt the true Temple, whom they had flain.</p>
                  <p>His falſe accuſers did repeat (though at unawares) and as it were tranſlate the words of the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> in <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 26, 27. <note place="margin">Dan. 9. 26, 27.</note> namely, that the Meſſiah ſhould by his death deſtroy the City and Sanctuary, and cauſe Sacrifice and Oblation to ceaſe; and this very thing in true effect <hi>Stephen</hi> had taught, namely, that Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> ſhould deſtroy the holy place, and change the Cuſtomes that <hi>Moſes</hi> had delivered, and ſo conſequently change the Sabbath; and the Lord from heaven did juſtifie <hi>Stephen</hi> for this ſpeech, even in the face of the High <hi>Synedrion;</hi> for as he looked ſtedfaſtly into heaven, he ſaw the glory of God, and Jeſus ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the right hand of God; And as he avouched this before them all, <hi>Act.</hi> 7. 55, 56. they that ſate in the Council looked <note place="margin">Act. 6. 15. Act. 7. 55.</note> ſtedfaſtly on him, and ſaw his face as the face of an Angel, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. 15. And this doth evince, that as <hi>Stephen</hi> did juſtifie his Doctrine by the words of the Angel <hi>Gabriel,</hi> ſo God did juſtifie him by making his face to ſhine before the Council, as the countenance of the Angel <hi>Gabriel,</hi> by which miraculous glory in his countenance the Council might have ſeen that his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:44298:57"/>
was warranted by the words of the Angel <hi>Gabriel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Stephen</hi> affirmed that which his falſe witneſſes affirmed againſt him as a blaſphemous thing, that Jeſus of <hi>Nazaret</hi> ſhould change the Cuſtomes of <hi>Moſes:</hi> Hence I reaſon thus, If Jeſus ſhould do it, then he did not leave it to be done in an arbitrary way by the diſcretion of particular Churches; But Jeſus him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf did it.</p>
                  <p>Mark the phraſe of ſpeaking; <hi>Jeſus of Nazaret ſhall change the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">That Chriſt Jeſus made three main changes in the ten Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements.</note> 
                     <hi>Cuſtomes of</hi> Moſes: And it is alſo obſervable, that Jeſus of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaret</hi> did make three main changes in the ten Commandements, two in the outward form of his publick worſhip contained in the ſecond Commandement, and one touching the day of his publick worſhip in the fourth Commandement.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 He changed Circumciſion and all typical purifyings (which were commanded in the ſecond Commandement) into the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental Seal of Baptiſm.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 He changed the Paſſeover, and all typical Sacrifices, which were alſo commanded in the ſecond Commandement, into the Sacramental Seal of the Lords Supper.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 He changed the ſeventh day as it was a typical ſign, by tranſlating it to the firſt day of the week, wherein Chriſt roſe as a Lord and Conqueror of Satans Head-plot, for the day of his publick worſhip, as the ſeventh day was at firſt.</p>
                  <p>And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> doth reaſon much after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as <hi>Stephen</hi> did; <hi>If</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Prieſthood be changed, there muſt</hi>

                     <hi>of neceſſity be a change of the Law,</hi> Heb. 7. 12. but the Prieſthood is changed (for Chriſt was not of the Tribe of <hi>Levie,</hi> but of <hi>Judah,</hi> neither was he made a High-prieſt by man according to the Law of the carnal Commandement, but (by God) after the power of endleſſe life) therefore Chriſt did not leave it to the power of his particular Churches to change the Ordinances of <hi>Moſes,</hi> but he had power from God to do it; <hi>He taketh away the firſt, that he</hi>

                     <hi>might eſtabliſh the ſecond,</hi> Heb. 9. 10. that is to ſay, Chriſt onely had power to take away Sacrifices, and all the other Cuſtomes of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that ſo he might ratifie his own Sacrifice in the place of them all, and therefore for the memorial of his Sacrifice, he hath now ordained two Sacramental Seals, which he hath annexed to the preaching of his Goſpel; the one he hath appointed as a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of initiation to his Church, and the other as a Sacrament

of confirmation to all beleevers: And therefore Chriſt Jeſus hath not now tyed his publick worſhip, neither to typical per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, nor to typical places, nor to typical dayes and times, for by his death he hath ended all the Types of his Death; and he hath changed the Prieſt-hood of <hi>Levie</hi> into the number of the Elect, <hi>Jer.</hi> 33. 18, 21, 22. and the typical place of his worſhip into par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches, and into godly hearts, ſaying, <hi>In every place In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe</hi>

                  <p n="1">1 I Do not mean that Chriſt left the day of his publick worſhip <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>1</label> to the diſcretion of his Apoſtles, to appoint what day they thought good in place of the ſeventh day, though their appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had been a ſufficient warrant for us, knowing by what ſpirit they were guided; but my meaning is, that Chriſt himſelf did appoint the day, and therefore in the day of his Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he did uſe means to aſſemble his Diſciples together, that he might meet with them, and declare unto them the things that appertained to the Kingdome of God; he firſt appeared to <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> and at her ſecond coming to his Sepulchre, he bid her tell his Diſciples, that <hi>He was riſen from the dead,</hi> Joh. 20. 17. 18.</p>
                  <p>Then he appeared unto two of his Diſciples as they went from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to <hi>Emaus,</hi> Luke 24. and he proved his Reſurrection to them from the Scriptures, and opened their underſtandings to underſtand what he ſaid; and this he did to draw them back again to the reſt of the Diſciples, partly that they might teſtifie the certainty of his Reſurrection, and partly that they might not be abſent from the Aſſembly when he ſhould come unto them, to inſtruct them further concerning his Death and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection. And at that Aſſembly he alſo opened their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings that they might underſtand the Scriptures which he alleged, for he ſaid unto them, <hi>Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Chriſt to ſuffer, and to riſe again from the dead the third day,</hi> Luke 24. 45, 46.</p>
                  <p>I grant it was ſomewhat late in the evening ere Chriſt came unto their Aſſembly; but yet that time of the evening is plainly called the ſame firſt day of the week, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20. 19. But the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular <note place="margin">Joh. 20. 19.</note> Scriptures, which he alleged to prove his Reſurrection, are not recorded, neither by <hi>Luke</hi> nor <hi>John;</hi> but yet we may gather by conſequence, that when he ſpake of his Death and Reſurrection, he might well ſpeak how he had ended all <hi>Moſes</hi> Ceremonies,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:44298:59"/>
and ſo conſequently how he had ended the typical uſe of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath by his death, and then doubtleſſe he would nominate ſome other day in the place of it, for the uſe of his publick Worſhip; or elſe he had left it to diſorder and confuſion, if he had left it arbitrary to particular Churches.</p>

I confeſſe, if it can be proved, that Chriſt had appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to them on any other day between the day of his Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and that day ſeven-night, then his appearing on that day ſeven-night had not been ſo remarkable; but ſeeing hee did not appear any more unto them till that day ſeven-night, it ſtrongly argues, that he did purpoſely abſtain from them the whole week, to declare his election of that day in the place of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day; and I am the more confirmed in the truth of this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this ſecond time of his meeting was not occaſioned by any Sabbatical feaſt of the <hi>Iews,</hi> for the laſt day of the feaſt of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leavened bread (which was a chief feſtival Sabbath) was paſt two days before this ſecond meeting, and none of the feſtival days (which doubtleſſe his Apoſtles kept) was any occaſion of his meeting with them ſooner than the ſame day ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night after his Reſurrection; it argues therefore that this Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of the Apoſtles and Diſciples was done by Chriſts dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; and <hi>Luke</hi> doth teſtifie, that Chriſt did give certain Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements to his Apoſtles after his Reſurrection, being ſeen of them at times forty days, and ſpeaking that which appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the Kingdome of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 2, 3. now what thoſe Commandements were, and what thoſe things were which hee ſpake concerning the Kingdome of God, is not recorded; but yet it may be collected from the practiſe of the Apoſtles, in that they uſed the firſt day of the week for Gods publick Worſhip in Chriſtian Churches, that Chriſt did command them to obſerve that day in place of the ſeventh day, as ſoon as they were ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the <hi>Iews</hi> Synagogues into particular Chriſtian Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; and we may the rather conceive this to be a true collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe he did at this preſent give unto his Apoſtles a new

                  <p>Obj. <hi>You ſay, That the ſecond time of Chriſts appearing was the ſame day ſeven-night after his Reſurrection; but that cannot be, becauſe</hi> John <hi>ſaith it was eight days after,</hi> Joh. 20. 26.</p>

take a part of the day wherein the firſt Miracle was wrought, and a part of the day in which Chriſt was Transfigured, then it was eight dayes, but ſtill it was but ſeven nights.</p>
                  <p>In like ſort, it was eight dayes from Chriſts firſt appearing to his next appearing, as <hi>John</hi> ſpeaketh, if you count a part of the former, and a part of the latter day into the number, but if you account it by nights, then it was no more but ſeven nights; ſo that after a ſort it was eight dayes, but yet in true account of dayes natural, which is according to the account of the dayes of the week, it was no more but ſeven nights.

                  <p n="3">3 A third Reaſon that doth perſwade me that Chriſt hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained his Reſurrection-day, as the day of his publick worſhip in <label type="milestone">

This day of Penticoſt was the firſt day of the week, in which he aroſe from the dead, as it may be calculated by the account of fifty dayes which muſt take their beginning from the ſecond Sabbath, that is to ſay from the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond day of the Feaſt of Unleavened-bread (or from the morrow after the firſt Feſtival day, <hi>Lev.</hi> 23. 15, 16.) to the day of Penticoſt, <note place="margin">Lev. 23 15, 16.

In the firſt Feſtival Sabbath Chriſt was crucified, the morrow after was the Sabbath, or ſeventh day, in which he lay in his grave; thence begins the reckoning to the day of Penticoſt.</p>
                  <p>Object. <hi>It may be objected, that Chriſt appeared with the promiſe of the Father to his Apoſtles on this day, becauſe it was the Feſtival day of Penticoſt, rather than becauſe it was the firſt day of the week.</hi>

                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> I anſwer, That Chriſt had aboliſhed the Command for the uſe of all Feſtival Sabbaths by his death, and therefore his appearing now was not in honour of that Feſtival Sabbath, but it was purpoſely becauſe this day was the firſt day of the week in which he aroſe as a Lord and Conqueror of Satans Head-plot, and becauſe he had now ordained it as the day of his publick

worſhip in the place of the ſeventh day, and in that reſpect alſo he made choice of this day to gift them with the immediate gift of Tongues, for the more ſpeedy ſpreading of the Goſpel all the world over, on the firſt day of the week, as the conſtant ſtanding day of his publick worſhip.</p>
                  <p>I conclude therefore, that the ſame wonderfull providence that did order the Reſurrection of Chriſt to fall out upon the firſt day of the week, did order the day of Penticoſt to fall out at this time on the firſt day of the week.</p>
                  <p>And by this Miracle of fiery cloven tongues on this day, Chriſt did not onely teſtifie that it was he that gave the Fiery Law at firſt, when he ſounded out the Law in fire at Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> (which time hath ever ſince been called Penticoſt) for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of his people in faith and holineſſe, but alſo that it was he that would ſound out his Law of the glad tydings of the Goſpel to all Nations, by this new gift of fiery tongues which he beſtowed upon his Apoſtles whilſt they were in a Church Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, for the more effectual, and more ſpeedy ſpreading of the Goſpel in all Chriſtian Churches in every firſt day of the week; and as an earneſt thereof there were three thouſand ſouls conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at this meeting.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 A fourth Reaſon that doth perſwade me that Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf hath ordained his Reſurrection-day for the day of his publick <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>4</label> Worſhip in the place of the ſeventh day, is this, namely becauſe the Apoſtle did cauſe the Chriſtian Churches of <hi>Corinth</hi> to aſſemble together on this firſt day of the week, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 1, 2. <note place="margin">1 Cor. 16. 1, 2.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> did not now by this Epiſtle firſt begin to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point this Church to meet together every firſt day of the week; for he ſaith, <hi>

                  <p>Hence it is evident, that the firſt day of the week, when Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians met together, (or as the Apoſtles phraſe is, when they are met, namely, according to their uſual and conſtant cuſtome) to worſhip God, then he did exhort them to lay aſide ſomething for the poor, for that day was a good day for their ſouls, and therefore that ſeaſon was a good ſeaſon to lay aſide ſomething for the poor Saints that were at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>

I grant that the word, Every firſt day, is not fully expreſſed in the Greek Text, but yet it muſt neceſſarily be underſtood, as it appears by the conſequence, for the Apoſtle did glory of their willing mind to them of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> ſaying, that <hi>Achaia</hi> (in which Country the City of <hi>Corinth</hi> was ſeated) was prepared <hi>Ayeer ag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But how could the Apoſtle have thus gloried of their zeal, and of their willing mind <note place="margin">2 Cor 9. 2.</note> to them of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> if they had laid up ſomething but once onely upon ſome one firſt day of the week, and no more? (as ſome would have the Text to ſpeak) doubtleſſe therefore they did lay aſide ſomething, either every firſt day of the week (or at leaſt uſually) when they were met together for the exerciſe of Gods worſhip, and in ſo doing, their zeal was exemplary to provoke them of <hi>Macedonia</hi> to imitate their example; and this is the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be beleeved, becauſe the Apoſtle doth ſtill exhort them to perform that duty, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 10, 11, 12.</p>
                  <p>I conclude therefore, that though the word <hi>Every</hi> be not fully expreſſed in the Greek Text, yet that it muſt neceſſarily be underſtood, and therefore the <hi>Geneva</hi> Tranſlation that puts it in, is to be juſtified, becauſe it is according to the true ſenſe of the place.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Touching this phraſe, <hi>Let every one of you lay by him in ſtore,</hi> I dare not affirm that this is meant of laying up by the Deacons Collection, but I rather think it was done by ſeparating ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by way of Vow for the uſe of the ſaid poor in every ones own hand, (which was as ſure a courſe, as if it had been put into the Box of the poor) for in this phraſe <hi>[Let every one of you lay by him in ſtore.]</hi> The Apoſtle doth <hi>Thalmudize,</hi> as relating therein to a certain cuſtome of the Jews in vowing ſomething to the poor; for the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors ſay, That Alms is comprehended in the general of Vows; and therefore he that ſaith thus, Lo this Shekel (or this Shilling) is an Alms, he is bound to give it to the poor out of hand; But if there be no poor preſent, he is bound to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate it, and to lay it Up till he find ſome poor.

The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> did lay this duty of Vowing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the Churches of <hi>Galatia, Corinth</hi> and <hi>Macedonia,</hi> namely, That every one of them ſhould ſeparate ſomething for the poor, and lay it up on the firſt day of the week when they were met together, for that day was a fitter day for that duty, than any other day of

the week: And the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors do adde this to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſpeech, <hi>That if a man had purpoſed</hi> (to give ſuch a quantity to the poor) <hi>but in his heart onely, he was bound to pay it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3 Hence it is evident, That the firſt day of the week, was by Chriſts Inſtitution the day of publick Worſhip in place of the ſeventh day, or elſe the Apoſtle would never have given direction to the Churches to ſeparate ſomething for the poor when they were me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="5">5 A fifth Reaſon that doth perſwade me, that Chriſt himſelf <label type="milestone">

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>2</label> of Chriſts Reſurrection, as more eminent than the ſeventh day, is taken from the Law of Circumciſion which was ſo ſtrictly tied to the eighth day, that though the eighth day did fall out upon the Sabbath day, yet they muſt prefer the doing of the act of Circumciſion, becauſe it was the eighth day, rather than the act of reſt, becauſe it was the ſeventh day, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7. 22. And the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> Doctors do affirm that Circumciſion in the time thereof <note place="margin">Joh. 7. 22.</note> drives away the Sabbath; that is to ſay, A man muſt omit to keep the reſt of the Holy Sabbath to circumciſe his child on the eighth day; if the Sabbath be the eighth day, ſeven dayes together the young Infant was in his blood of uncleanneſſe, but on the eighth day it muſt be circumciſed for the full cleanſing of it from all the pollution that did accompany it in the birth.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>And why was this eighth day made more eminent than all the other ſeven dayes? but to type out unto us the eminency of the Reſurrection-day of Chriſt above the ſeventh day for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of Gods publick worſhip to the worlds end; and the New Teſtament doth tell us of a great number of Chriſtians that were gathered into a great Church Aſſembly on this day at <hi>Jeruſalem Act.</hi> 2. 41. And this great Aſſembly was from divers parts, and quarters of the world, for many of the diſperſed Jewes that did beleeve, reſorted to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> from remote Countries at Feſtival times, and many that were converted to the faith did there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, untill they were diſperſed again at the death of <hi>Stephen,</hi> which diſperſion God turned to the further enlargement of his
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:44298:64"/>
Church for many of theſe diſperſed Diſciples preached the Goſpel in ſundry parts of the world where they travelled, and by that means a multitude, both of Jews and Heathens, became Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and theſe Chriſtians, in time made many Chriſtian Church-Aſſemblies, and they all uſed to meet together on the firſt day of the week, which was the next day after the ſeventh, and ſo it was the eighth day, which was typified by the eighth and laſt day of the Feaſt of Tabernacles.</p>
                  <p>A ſixth Reaſon is borrowed from the Jubilee Yeer which by Gods ſpecial Providence was ordained to be in the eighth yeer <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>6</label> after the ſeventh ſeven, and this ſabbatical yeer was ordained to be a greater Sabbath than the ſeventh ſeven, becauſe it was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to give a more full deliverance to Gods people than the ſeventh ſeven, <hi>Lev.</hi> 25. 4, 8, 20.</p>
                  <p>The ſeventh ſeven was the forty and ninth yeer, and the next <note place="margin">Lev. 25. 4.</note> yeer after the ſeventh ſeven was the eighth yeer, and it was alſo the fiftieth yeer, or the Jubilee yeer.</p>
                  <p>And both theſe Sabbatical yeers thus ſucceeding each other do moſt lively point out unto us, how the Lords Reſurrection-day (by which we have a full Jubilee of deliverance from Satans Head-plot) ſhould ſucceed the Sabbath, or ſeventh day.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Three things are remarkable touching the number Eight.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1 That the number Eight was myſtical as well as the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Seven.</p>

                  <p n="3">3 That the number Eight was a Sabbatical number as well as the number Seven.</p>
                  <p>Now ſeeing theſe things have been made cleer, and cannot be denied, how can it be denied, but that the number eight muſt needs have relation not onely to the Reſurrection of Chriſt on the eighth day (that is to ſay on the next day after the ſeventh day) but alſo that the ſaid day muſt be eſtabliſhed as a Sabbatical day among Chriſtians in the New Teſtament in the place of the ſeventh day?</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Propounding ſome Reaſons why the Apoſtles did allow of the Jewiſh Sabbath, or ſeventh day, in their Synagogues, for a time after it was aboliſhed by the death of Chriſt, as well as of the Lords Day in Chriſtian Churches.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THe Apoſtles knew well enough that Chriſt had ordained his Reſurrection-day as the day of his publick Worſhip, in place of the ſeventh day, and therefore in that reſpect they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed all Chriſtian Churches to obſerve that day for Gods publick Worſhip, and yet notwithſtanding they ſtill reſorted to Gods publick Worſhip on the ſeventh day in the <hi>Jews</hi> Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues, for a certain ſpace of years after the death of Chriſt; I ſay, for ſome ſpace of time the Apoſtles did allow by way of permiſſion the uſe of the Sabbath, or ſeventh day, yea they did allow of the uſe of Sacrifices alſo in the Temple for a time, for they knew that as long as Chriſt was willing to ſuffer the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to ſtand undeſtroyed, that he was willing to ſuffer and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the uſe of Sacrifices and Sabbaths, and therefore for the weakneſſe ſake of many beleeving <hi>Jews,</hi> that did as yet remain in their old Synagogues, the Apoſtles did ſee it convenient to allow of the uſe of the ſeventh day for Gods publick Worſhip in their Synagogues, according to their ancient known cuſtom; yea moreover the Apoſtles did ſee it convenient to allow of the uſe of Circumciſion, and of all the other Cuſtoms of <hi>Moſes</hi> alſo for a time, for the weakneſſe ſake of many ten thouſand <hi>Iews</hi> that did beleeve in Chriſt, becauſe that many of theſe beleeving <hi>Iews</hi> did ſtill continue to be zealous aſſertors of the cuſtoms of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, <hi>Act.</hi> 21. 20. for many of theſe beleeving <hi>Iews</hi> were <note place="margin">Acts 21. 20</note> not only eminent for faith in Chriſt, but alſo they were eminent for zeal in <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, as we may ſee in the example of <hi>Ananias</hi> that opened <hi>Pauls</hi> eyes; It is recorded of him, that he was a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man, as pertaining to the Law, <hi>Act.</hi> 22. 12, and it is alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded, that there were divers other <hi>Iews</hi> that did beleeve in Chriſt, and yet they ſtill continued zealous not only for Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, but alſo for all the other cuſtoms of <hi>Moſes,</hi> Act. 15. 5. <note place="margin">Act. 15. 5. 24</note>
                     <pb n="117" facs="tcp:44298:66"/>
and it was for the ſake of theſe beleeving <hi>Iews</hi> that as yet remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Synagogues, that the Apoſtles did by way of permiſſion allow of the uſe of the Sabbath day in their Synagogues till a convenient time of Reformation.</p>
                  <p>And out of this conſideration it was that the Apoſtles in their Decrees at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> did not abſolutely forbid the uſe of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. and out of this conſideration it was, that <hi>Paul</hi> took liberty to Circumciſe <hi>Timothy,</hi> that ſo he might there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by win the affection of the ſaid Synagogues where ſome belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>Iews</hi> were, to his perſon and Miniſtry, <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 3. <note place="margin">Acts 16. 3</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yea a long ſpace after the death of Chriſt, he did by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Apoſtle <hi>Iames</hi> take upon him to be a Conſort with four men, that took upon them a <hi>Levitical</hi> vow, namely, the <hi>Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites</hi> Vow; and <hi>Paul</hi> did well-nigh obſerve all the days of Purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation according to the cuſtom of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law; and he was alſo ready prepared to pay his part and ſhare of their Sacrifice to be <note place="margin">See <hi>Ainſw.</hi> in Numb. 6. 18</note> offered in the Temple, had not the Malignant <hi>Iews</hi> hindered him, by apprehending his Perſon, in a ſudden rage againſt him for pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luting the holy Temple, as they ſurmiſed, <hi>Act.</hi> 21. 24. And for <note place="margin">Acts 21. 24</note> this very reaſon the Apoſtles made no ſcruple at all to preach on the Sabbath, or ſeventh day, in the <hi>Iews</hi> Synagogues, for in the Synagogues the <hi>Iews</hi> obſerved no other day but the ſeventh day, as it is evident by <hi>Acts</hi> 13. <hi>Acts</hi> 16. <hi>Acts</hi> 17. <hi>Acts</hi> 18, &amp;c.

                  <p>In theſe words the Apoſtle doth exhort them, not to let any man to rule over them as Judges of their Chriſtian liberty, by inforcing and perſwading their Conſciences to the obſervation of <hi>Moſes</hi> ceremonies, ſeeing they were but ſhadows of ſomething to come, namely, they were but ſhadows of ſomthing to be fulfilled by Chriſt; for Chriſt the Body was already come in the place of them all; yea ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Let no man beguile you of your prize,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>That which I aym at by this diſcourſe is this, namely, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that there were ſome beleeving <hi>Jews</hi> in the Church of <hi>Coloſſe</hi> that did earneſtly contend (not only for the obſervation of <hi>Moſes</hi> ceremonies in general, but alſo that did in particular contend) for the obſervation of the Jewiſh Sabbath, as the only commanded day of Gods publick Worſhip in Chriſtian Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; and hence I infer, that theſe beleeving <hi>Jews</hi> needed not to have contended ſo earneſtly for the obſervation of the Jewiſh Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, if the Apoſtles had not laid the obſervation of it aſide, and required Chriſtian Churches to obſerve the Lords Day for their Chriſtian aſſemblies, in the place of the ſeventh day.</p>
                  <p>Obj. 2. <hi>I conceive theſe beleeving</hi> Jews <hi>did not contend for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the Jewiſh Sabbath, as you think, but for the obſervation of the other Feſtival Sabbaths; againſt which only the Apoſtle doth ſpeak.</hi>

their weekly Sabbaths, or ſeventh day; for the weekly Sabbath was a typical ſign as well as their other Feſtival Sabbaths, and therefore the death of Chriſt doth aboliſh them all alike.</p>

                  <p>Object. 3. <hi>It ſeems to me that our Saviour did not ordain his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection-day in place of the ſeventh day, becauſe our Saviour in</hi> Mat. 24. 20. <note place="margin">Mat. 24. 20.</note> 
                     <hi>doth warn his Diſciples to pray (at the time of their deſtruction by the</hi> Romans) <hi>that their flight might not be, neither in the Winter, nor upon the Sabbath day: Now if Chriſt had aboliſhed the Sabbath by his death, as you affirm, then be would not have given this caution of praying that their flight might not be on the Sabbath day, ſo long after his death, for it was about forty yeers after his death ere the City was deſtroyed by the</hi> Romans.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Chriſt did not give this caution to his Diſciples in the nature of a Command, or forbidding, but in the nature of a diſ-allowing of the Jews ſuperſtitious opinion of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward reſt of the Sabbath, ſo long after his death: They might in that ſpace have been better taught and inſtructed, if they had not been enemies to the Goſpel of Chriſt, but becauſe they would not be inſtructed, therefore our Saviour told his Diſciples, that the <hi>Jews</hi> of <hi>Judea</hi> in general would hold ſuch a ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious opinion, both of the holineſſe of the Temple, and of the outward reſt of the Sabbath day, that it would be a grievous calamity to them if they were forced to flye for their lives upon the Sabbath day, more than upon any other day in the week: But yet this muſt be marked, that our Saviour ſpeaks this to his Diſciples, but as a Prophetical Hiſtorian, foretelling them what would be the common opinion of the Nation of the Jews in thoſe dayes, namely, that they would be infected with ſuch a ſuperſtitious opinion of the holineſſe of the outward reſt of the Sabbath, that they would neither ſtir hand or foot to break the outward reſt of the Sabbath by flight to ſave their lives. This caution of our Saviour to his Diſciples muſt needs be underſtood in this ſenſe, becauſe the whole frame of his ſpeech is fetched (by way of alluſion) to a former like ſad calamity, which fell upon them under <hi>Anti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="127" facs="tcp:44298:71"/>
they ſuffered extreme miſeries by reaſon of their ſuperſtitious opinion of the outward reſt of the Sabbath day, which they might have prevented, if they had held it lawful at firſt, as they did at laſt, that in caſe of neceſſity they might either fight or flie for their lives upon the Sabbath day.</p>
                  <p>Our Saviour in this his ſpeech to his Diſciples doth allude to the times of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> and therefore he doth mention the Winter as well as the Sabbath day, for <hi>Judas Maccabeus</hi> did cleanſe the Temple and the Altar in the Winter, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 22. and three yeers before it was polluted in the Winter, 1 <hi>Mac.</hi> 1. 54. And ſecondly, it was alſo polluted upon the Sabbath day, 1 <hi>Mac.</hi> 2. 38. and now it was a time of grievous calamity to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by way of alluſion to this calamitous time, our Saviour bad them pray, That their flight might neither be in the Winter, nor yet upon the Sabbath day, for then they would do as they had done, neither fight nor flye to ſave their lives. This their blind zeal our Saviour reproves, 1 <hi>Mac.</hi> 2, 34. 36. 38. 41. and 2 <hi>Mac.</hi> 6. 11.</p>
                  <p>It follows therefore by good conſequence, that our Saviour did not now in ſadneſſe teach his Diſciples the continuance of the Sabbath ſo long after his death, no more than he taught them the continuance of the ſervice of the Temple, by calling the Temple <hi>The Holy Place,</hi> verſ. 15. But no man, I think, will ſay, that Chriſt did then eſteem the Temple to be the Holy Place, but he names it ſo <hi>Docaſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

By this it is evident that Chriſt ſpake by alluſion to former times<hi>:</hi> But he knew well enough that the holineſſe of the Temple, as well as the typical Reſt of the Holy Sabbath, were fully ended by his death.</p>
                  <p>I grant, that the Temple was once truly called the Holy Temple, becauſe it was ordained to be a type of the holy humane nature of Chriſt wherein his God-head dwelt, <hi>Job.</hi> 2<hi>:</hi> But yet this typical holineſſe of the Temple muſt needs have an end, as ſoon as the Holy of Holies did but enter through the vail of his fleſh into heaven to appear before God for us, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 24. with <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 50, 51. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14. and the goodlineſſe alſo of the Temple muſt
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:44298:72"/>
have an end as ſoon as he that was greater than the Temple had finiſhed his Oblation, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 26. and by the like reaſon alſo the Sabbath, as it was a type of our reſting on the Seed of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to break the Devils Head-plot, muſt end as ſoon as Chriſt had finiſhed his Sacrifice of Attonement.</p>
                  <p>I will therefore conclude my anſwer to this Objection, That Chriſt by this ſpeech of his to his Diſciples did but tell them what would be the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon opinion of the Nation of the <hi>Jews</hi> at the time of the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as I have already declared it; but he intended no more to teach them the continuance of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, than the continuance of the Holineſſe of the Temple; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did he by this Caution to his Diſciples intend to prefer the Sabbath above the Lords day, no more than he intended to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Winter above the Summer, of all which things he ſpake by way of caution to his Diſciples what would be the common opinion of the <hi>Jews</hi> at the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Object. 4. <hi>If Chriſt had ordained his Reſurrection-day as the day of his publick Worſhip in place of the Sabbath or ſeventh day, then me thinks the Apoſtles in their Writings ſhould have recorded it, with the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of it, namely, the time when, and how he did ordain it; if this had been done, the matter had been out of queſtion to all men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Wiſdome of God did not ſee it good to make all his Ordinances cleer to all men at the firſt ſight; when our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour was here upon the earth, he did oftentimes open his mouth in Parables, that they which ſee not might not perceive, and that his beſt ſervants might dig for his hidden Treaſures: But I may ſay alſo it is not recorded that Chriſt did inſtruct any of his Apoſtles of the time when, nor of the manner how he did firſt ordain <hi>John</hi> to baptiſe, but becauſe all men generally held <hi>John</hi> to be a Prophet, therefore they concluded that he had received ſome authority from heaven to baptiſe ſubjects for Chriſt, againſt he came into his Kingdome, which he proclamed to be at hand; and by the like authority, we may conclude that the Apoſtles did command the obſervation of the Lords day for Gods publick Worſhip in the place of the ſeventh day, becauſe it was in frequent uſe in their dayes, as I have proved, and they being Prophets, had ſpecial direction from Chriſt the Lord of the Sabbath ſo to direct his Churches, which directions in all probability they received from him at his firſt comming

to their Aſſembly in the evening of his Reſurrection-day, or elſe in the evening of his ſecond coming to their Aſſembly, on that day ſeven-night, <hi>Joh.</hi> 19. 20. 26. for then he opened their underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to underſtand ſuch Scriptures as he alleged concerning his <note place="margin">Joh. 19. 20, 26.</note> Death and Reſurrection, <hi>Luke</hi> 23. 54. 47. and then alſo he gave them a new Commiſſion to preach the Doctrine of the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſins in his name, <hi>Joh,</hi> 20. 21, 22, 23. and then he gave Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements unto them, and ſpake of ſuch things as appertained to the Kingdome of God, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 2, 3. doubtleſſe therefore he did then inſtruct them concerning the day of his publick worſhip wherein they muſt preach forgiveneſs of ſins in his name to all the world; and this Commiſſion he did again renew unto them before his aſcenſion, ſaying, <hi>Go and teach all Nations, baptizing them in the Name of the Father, Son, and holy Ghoſt, teaching them to obſerve all things whatſoever I have commanded you, and lo I am with you alwayes to the end of the world.</hi> Whatſoever therefore the Apoſtles com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Chriſtian Churches to obſerve, they did it by vertue of Chriſts former command; and therefore <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of the Lord that which I have delivered unto you,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 23. The Commandements therefore which the Apoſtles gave unto the Chriſtian Churches, they were the Commandements of Chriſt, among which Commandements, the obſervation of the Lords day muſt needs be one in place of the Sabbath, which was fully aboliſhed by the death of Chriſt.</p>

And this Feaſt I conceive was a Wedding Feaſt, though I alſo beleeve that the new maried parties were maried before this day, &amp; not on this day, <note place="margin">It is unlawfull to begin a Mariage upon the Sabbath day. Lev. 23 8.</note> for the <hi>Jews</hi> held it utterly unlawful to begin their Mariage upon the Sabbath day. See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 23. 8.

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:44298:73"/>
corrupt circumſtances which did accompany this Feaſt. 1 He found fault with ſome of the gueſts, becauſe they choſe out the uppermoſt ſeats. 2 He ſeemed to reprove the Governour of the Feaſt, becauſe he invited his rich friends onely, verſ. 12. But Chriſt told him it had been more ſuitable to the Sabbath day if he had invited the poor to his Feaſt: And yet I beleeve it was not ſinfull to bid the rich; for if it had been ſinfull, Chriſt would ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have declined the invitation, or elſe he would have born witneſſe againſt it as a ſinful practiſe; but he did neither of theſe, therefore it was not ſinful to invite the rich to a Feaſt upon the Sabbath day, where the Feaſt muſt laſt ſeven dayes together.</p>
                  <p>2 I anſwer, That it was as lawfull for the <hi>Jews</hi> to kindle a fire upon the Sabbath day to prepare warm food for infirm and weak ſtomacks (which are almoſt in every family) as it was to do any other work of mercy: And it was lawfull to do works of mercy upon the Sabbath dayes, as it is evident by our Saviours often ſhewing of compaſſion to weak and ſickly perſons upon the Sabbath day.</p>
                  <p>3 I anſwer, that the Prieſts did hold it lawfull to kindle new fires on the Sabbath dayes for the uſe of their Sacrifices; I grant they had one conſtant and continual fire that was alwayes main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the ſide of the Altar; but from this fire they uſed to kindle other fires for the burning of ſuch parts of their Sacrifices as they offered on the Sabbath dayes. Hence I infer, that ſeeing Chriſt Jeſus hath told us that he doth prefer mercy before Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, no queſtion but he allowed the <hi>Jews</hi> to kindle a fire for works of mercy, as well as for the uſe of Sacrifices, on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, and therefore out of doubt they might kindle a fire on the Sabbath day to prepare neceſſary food for ſuch as are infirm of nature.

                  </p>
                  <p>4 I anſwer, That the Prieſts did kindle new fires every Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day to boyl or roaſt their portion of meat which was due unto them from each Sacrifice by Gods allowance; for God commanded them to eat their part and portion in the ſame day wherein the Sacrifice was offered, <hi>Lev.</hi> 7. 15. but they could not eat this portion, unleſſe they kindled a fire, either to boyl it, or roaſt it.</p>
                  <p>5 On the day of Attonement (which was a Sabbath of Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batiſm, and therefore every was as ſtrict for reſt as the Sabbath

                  <p>But for the better underſtanding of the true ſenſe of this text, it is neceſſary to compare it with the like prohibition in <hi>Exod.</hi> 31. 1, &amp;c. where the Lord commanded <hi>Moſes</hi> to command <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaliel</hi> to make the Tabernacle, and all the appurtenances there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, with all diligence; that is to ſay, with all poſſible ſpeed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any delay, becauſe it was to be for the place of the Lords reſidence among them, <hi>Exod.</hi> 25. 8. 22. but yet notwithſtanding this careful diligence, the Lord commanded <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſaying in ver. 13. <hi>Speak unto the Sons of Iſrael, and ſay, Verily</hi> (or notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, <note place="margin">Exod 31. 13</note> as the Seventy read it) <hi>my Sabbaths yee ſhall keep, for it is a ſign between me and you, throughout your Generations, to know that I am Jehovah that ſanctifieth you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In theſe words God gave a double reaſon why they might not do any work about the making of the Tabernacle upon the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath Day.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>This phraſe implies, That for their double ſin in prophaning Gods ſanctified Time, and Gods ſanctified Sign, they ſhould bee put to dye ſuch a kind of death, as was after a ſort a double death; for 1. He muſt be ſtoned to death; and 2. His dead body muſt be after his death hanged upon a Tree till Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, for the greater deteſtation of that Sin, and for the greater terror of others; for this is a thing upon Record in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors, That all ſuch Malefactors as deſerved ſtoning to death muſt be hanged up afterwards upon a Tree, as it is manifeſt alſo by the inſtance of the rebellious Son, in <hi>Deut.</hi> 21. as I have ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the matter more at large elſewhere.</p>
                  <p>But if it be conceived by any, that if any man will now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to gather ſticks upon the Lords Day, he ſhould be puniſhed with ſtoning to death, as the man that gathered ſticks on the Sabbath Day was;</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, There is not the like reaſon, becauſe the Lords Day is not ordained to be a ſanctified ſign of Gods reſting, and of Mans reſting in the Seed of the Woman to break the Devils Head-plot, as the Sabbath was.</p>
                  <p>I conclude therefore, by comparing the work of the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle in <hi>Exod.</hi> 31. with the work of the Tabernacle, as it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated in <hi>Exod.</hi> 35. that the only reaſon why they might not kindle a fire in their Habitations on the Sabbath Day was, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain them from their eager deſire, from their raſh or ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious zeal to proſecute the work of the Tabernacle, which was commanded to be done with ſuch careful diligence for the place of Gods reſidence among them; the Lord doth prefix a prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to reſtrain them from kindling any fire for that work, and to prevent their raſh and heady zeal a threatning is annexed; <hi>Whoſoever doth any work</hi> (namely of his particular Calling) <hi>upon the Sabbath Day, ſhall be put to death, Exod.</hi> 35. 2. therefore yee ſhall kindle no fire for that buſineſſe, <hi>ver.</hi> 3.</p>
                  <p>And as it was unlawful for them to kindle a fire for ſuch works as belonged to their particular Callings on the Week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days, ſo out of all doubt it is as unlawful for Chriſtians to kindle a fire on the Lords Day to do any ſuch ſervile works as that was; but wherein can you finde a prohibition wherein the <hi>Jews</hi> are
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:44298:75"/>
forbidden to kindle a fire on the Sabbath Day for the dreſſing of neceſſary food for infirm or craſie bodies?</p>
                  <p>Queſt. 4. <hi>It ſeems to me, that the</hi> Jews <hi>might not kindle a fire on the Sabbath Day to dreſſe any meat at all therewith; for</hi> Moſes <hi>ſaith thus,</hi> To morrow is the Sabbath of Holineſſe to Jehovah, Bake that which yee will bake, and ſeeth that which yee will ſeeth <hi>(name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the ſixth day, as it is in ver.</hi> 5.) and all that remaineth over, lay it up for you as a reſervation until the morrow, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. 23. <hi>From this Scripture I think it is evident, That the</hi> Jews <hi>were prohibited</hi>

And truly I think there is no conſcientious Chriſtian that doth hold it lawful to defer, or put off ſuch like laborious works as theſe to the Lords Day, for it is all one as if a man ſhould defer the grinding of his Corn, the baking of his Bread, or the making of his Pies unto the Lords Day; but no conſcientious Chriſtian that is judicious (I think) doth hold it unlawful to temper a Pudding of the Meal that was ground on the ſixth day, or to heat a Pye that was made on the ſixt day, or to boyl a neceſſary quantity of meat that was killed and quartered on the ſixt day,

Now if it had been unlawful to prepare ſuch a ſmall quantity of food, as was fit for the preſent ſupport of nature, on the Sabbath Day, doubtleſſe Chriſt would have commanded his Apoſtles before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, to provide their Scrip full of Victuals, namely on the ſixt day; but in as much as he had not made ſuch proviſion on the ſixt day, but did juſtifie his Apoſtles for this work in the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath Day, by alleging the example of <hi>David</hi> in eating the Shew-bread in caſe of hunger, he did thereby confute and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the <hi>Iews</hi> ſuperſtitious opinion of the outward reſt of the Sabbath; alleging alſo, That the Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath, <hi>Mar.</hi> 2. 27. as if Chriſt had ſaid <note place="margin">Mar. 2. 27.</note> thus, If man had been made for the Sabbath, then man muſt have ſerved the Sabbath before his own neceſſity, but ſeeing man was not made for the Sabbath, but the Sabbath for man, namely to ſerve mans neceſſity, therefore it follows, that the Sabbath was made, ordained, or inſtituted, after man was in neceſſity, and in miſery, namely after <hi>Adams</hi> Fall, chiefly for the good of his ſick and ſinful Soul (and therefore God did bleſſe it with ſuitable Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and did ſanctifie that day for the uſe of thoſe Ordinances) but yet withall the Sabbath was made to ſerve man in miſery, in reſpect of his Body, that it might reſt and be refreſhed with convenient food, Phyſick, and the like, and therefore godly Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome will make all the godly careful to improve the Lords Day ſo, as that it may ſerve to the beſt good both of their ſinful Souls, and of their weak and frail bodies alſo.</p>

                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. In the dayes of our Saviour, ſome of the Jews were ſo ſupeſtitious of the outward reſt of the Sabbath, that they were often offended with our Saviour, becauſe he did works of mercy, and works of neceſſity on the Sabbath day; but it was not ſo with the Jews from elder times; <hi>Maymony</hi> ſaith, <hi>If a Thief dig thorow a houſe upon the Sabbath day, it is free for any to kill him with any death they can put him to.</hi> See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Exod.</hi> 22. 2. This they allowed <note place="margin">Exod. 22. 2.</note> as a caſe of preſent neceſſity, it could not be deferred, as a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate may defer the putting off a Malefactor to death, untill any one of the ſix dayes, becauſe the Magiſtrate hath the Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor in ſafe cuſtody in ſome ſure priſon; and therefore they ſay, It is not lawfull to put a Malefactor to death on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, becauſe it is written that no fire ſhall be kindled upon the Sabbath day, <hi>Exod.</hi> 35. 3. namely not for the uſe of any mans particular Calling (as I have already opened this Text) therefore no fire may be kindled upon the Sabbath day for the execution of a Malefactor, for that was but the work of the Magiſtrates ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Calling. See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Exod.</hi> 18. 22. and yet notwithſtanding <note place="margin">See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in Exod. 35. 3.</note> they held it lawfull for the Magiſtrate to put a Malefactor to death upon a Feſtival Sabbath (as it appears by their practice in <note place="margin">Joh. 19. 31.</note> putting our Saviour to death on a Feſtival Sabbath, for they did not hold thoſe Sabbaths to be equal to the ſeventh day) but if a Thief came to ſteal on the Seventh day, and was taken in dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thorow an houſe, they held it lawful for a private man to kill him on the Sabbath day (though they did not hold it lawfull for a Magiſtrate to kill a Thief then) becauſe it was a caſe of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:44298:79"/>
neceſſity, for he might eſcape unleſſe he were killed at that inſtant.</p>
                  <p>And truly Chriſtians may do as much as this on the Lords day, and no more, without ſin.</p>
                  <p>2 Our Saviour confuted the Jews ſuperſtitious conceit of the outward reſt of the Sabbath, by examples from their own practice; for when they took offence at his miraculous cures upon the Sabbath day, he asked them why they held it lawful to untie their Cattle, and lead them to the water upon the Sabbath day, and ſo to give them Hay and Provender, and to pull a Sheep out of the pit upon the Sabbath day; and therefore ſaid he, Why may not I ſhew mercy to a Daughter of <hi>Abraham</hi> that is in miſery upon the Sabbath day? And ſeeing they held it lawfull for <hi>Abia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thar</hi> to give the Shew-bread to hungry <hi>David,</hi> he asked them, Why it was not as lawful for his hungry Diſciples to pluck ears of corn and to rub them, and prepare them for the ſuſtenance of their preſent hunger upon the Sabbath day; and after Chriſt had cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Criple; he bad him take up his bed and walk, to ſave it from ſpoyling, and from loſſe, upon the Sabbath day; and when he cured blind eyes upon the Sabbath day with clay tempered into a ſalve, he did it to warrant Chirurgeon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, and Phyſitians, that they might lawfully temper their Potions and Plaſters upon the Sabbath day to cure the ſick and weak.</p>
                  <p>By theſe, and ſuch like examples in the New Teſtament, our Saviour declared what liberty God gave unto the Jews, to do works of mercy, or of preſent neceſſity, upon the Sabbath day; and truly thoſe Chriſtians that will contend for more liberty than this upon the Lords day, do in effect deny, that the Lords day was ordained with any ſolemn ſanctity.</p>
                  <p>3 Though the preſent Apoſtate Jews did malign our Savior for doing many works of mercy, and in preſent neceſſity, upon the Sabbath day; yet the ancient <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors, recorded by their later Doctors, held otherwiſe: They ſay, that the perill of life puts away the Sabbath, and therefore to a ſick perſon that is in danger of death, they do all things needfull for him upon the Sabbath day. See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 10. And though the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors do affirm that Circumciſion in the time thereof doth drive away the Sabbath, becauſe there was a neceſſity of doing it on the eighth day, (See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 12.) yet ſay the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:44298:79"/>
in caſe of ſickneſſe they do not circumciſe him that is ſick, untill he be well; (and again) they circumciſe none but children that are without ſickneſſe, for perill of life putteth away all. See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> on <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 13. And on the day of Attonement which was a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath of Sabbatiſm for ſtrict reſt, yet then they made ready pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of food for him that lead the Scape-Goat into the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe, yea though that Sabbath was alſo an exceeding ſtrict Faſting-day; yet then at the end of every mile they ſaid unto him that lead the Scape-Goat, <hi>Lo here is meat, and here is water, and if his ſtrength failed him, and if he had need to eat, he might eat.</hi> See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 16. 21. The <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors alſo ſay, That if the High Prieſt were an old man, or ſickly, he might have the water made warm, wherein he waſhed his body on that ſtrict Sabbath of Attonement, either by Irons made hot in the fire, or elſe by the mixture of ſome hot water with the cold. See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 16. 24. By theſe, and the like teſtimonies, we ſee that the ancient <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> Doctors held that the Sabbath was made for man in miſery, not onely for the curing of his ſick and ſinfull ſoul by thoſe bleſſed Ordinances wherewith God did at firſt bleſſe the ſeventh day, but even for the curing and comforting of his weak and ſickly body; and theſe are the chief ends for which the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath was ordained from the very firſt Inſtitution of it.</p>
                  <p>And the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors were very careful to provide a remedy againſt immoderate toyl and labour to mens bodies in travelling to the publick Ordinances which were diſpenced every Sabbath day in their Synagogues: For by vertue of Gods Command, there was a neceſſity laid upon all the Jews to reſort to ſome holy Convocation in all their dwellings, <hi>Lev.</hi> 23. 3. namely, in all their <note place="margin">Lev. 23. 3.</note> Synagogues, which muſt be placed in the midſt of their dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings. Hence the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors knowing the Command of God for ſuch holy Convocations in all their dwellings; (and knowing the Command of God to reſt on the ſeventh day from all their works) did appoint a certain diſtance how far men might travel on the Sabbath day to the Synagogue, and they thought good to reſtrain it to an Engliſh mile, to prevent the labour of travel, and the wearineſſe of mens bodies which might unfit them for the reverend attention to Gods Ordinances; and from this limited ſpace, it is that we read of a Sabbath dayes journey, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 12. They did not ordain this Sabbath dayes <note place="margin">Acts 1. 12</note>
                     <pb n="142" facs="tcp:44298:80"/>
journey for any Civil buſineſſes of mens particular Callings, but for the uſe of Religious duties, and for works of mercy on the Sabbath day.</p>
                  <p>And this proportion of a mile they took from the example of Gods limits which he allowed to the Suburbs of their Cities, for the Suburbs of their Cities might not exceed two thouſand Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits by meaſure, <hi>Num.</hi> 35. 5. The like diſtance God appointed between the Camp of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and the Ark of the Lords Covenant when they paſſed over the River <hi>Jordan,</hi> Joſ. 3. 4. From theſe eminent examples the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors ordained that no Tent ſhould be pitched in the Wilderneſſe, nor no Houſe in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> above two thouſand Cubits from their Synagogue-aſſemblies, which is an Engliſh mile; and this diſtance they uſually called A Sabbath dayes journey.</p>
                  <p>And this order was a provident proviſion both for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation of the Word (for by ſuch ſhort diſtances from their Synagogues they muſt have many Synagogues) and in order to a work of Mercy to their bodies, that they might not weary their bodies by long travel, when they came unto Gods preſence to be partakers of his holy Ordinances; but in caſes of neceſſity (they notwithſtanding this reſtraint to a mile) when the means of Grace did by any occaſion fail in any of their Synagogues at home, then they held it without ſcruple lawful to go further, as we may ſee by the liberty that the People took in the days of Chriſt, for then they did leave their Synagogues to follow his preaching from place to place; and if Chriſt had held their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice to be unlawful, doubtleſſe he would have reproved them, and bid them keep their own Synagogues, and not follow him from place to place as they did; and for the attaining of ſuch excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent means of Grace, the people alſo held it lawful to leave their own Synagogues, and to break the outward reſt of the Sabbath by longer Journies, and greater Bodily labour; and ſo we ſee that the Prieſts in the Law did break the outward reſt of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath by their laborious killing and dreſſing of Sacrifices, and yet they were blameleſſe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 5. 1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 23. 31. and ſo alſo for their Bodily food, they did kindle Fires to Roſt and Boyl the portion of their Sacrifices fit for their ſtomacks every Sabbath Day; for their portions muſt be eaten in the ſame day in which the Sacrifice was offered, nothing thereof muſt remain until the
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:44298:80"/>
morning; but in caſe any part of their portions did remain until the morning, it muſt be burnt, <hi>Levit.</hi> 7. 15. <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 10.</p>
                  <p>I conclude therefore, That the <hi>Jews</hi> had as much liberty in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects to do any thing on the Sabbath Day, tending to the good of their Souls, or to their Bodies, either in caſes of neceſſity or mercy, as Chriſtians have upon the Lords Day; but both ſorts have corrupt hearts alike, and have alike need to watch unto the ſanctified improvement of the whole day; and both ſorts have the ſame Adverſary the Devil to deal withall, and therefore both ſorts have need alike to keep a good watch over Satan, and over their own corrupt hearts, or elſe the ſpiritual efficacy of Gods Holy Ordinances will be loſt and vain, which is the only thing that the Devil deſires to effect, that he may rejoyce in the ruine of our Souls.</p>
                  <p>O that Chriſtians therefore would ſubmit their Conſciences to the command of Chriſt, to keep the Lords Day as ſtrictly from outward works, and as holily in all Chriſtian duties, as ever the <hi>Jews</hi> did, or ought to have kept the Sabbath Day.</p>
                  <p>And ſo Jehovah cauſe his face to ſhine upon every Soul that truly honours the ſanctified time of the Lords Day, and the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity of all publick and private holy duties. <hi>Amen, Amen.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1 That the Sanctified and ſeparated time of the Lords Day is juſt according to the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral day.</p>

                  <p>And for the want of the knowledge of theſe things, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb facs="tcp:44298:83"/>
that many godly perſons do the works of their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Callings in ſome part of the Lords ſanctified and ſeparated day, as thoſe do that begin and end the Lords Day at the Sun-ſet Evening, and for their better informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I forced my ſelf to compoſe this Treatiſe.</p>
                  <p>I finde that the chief ground of their error doth ariſe, Firſt, from a miſtaken interpretation of the firſt Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to be a full Night of twelve hours; and Secondly, from a miſtaken interpretation of the word Evening, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they apprehend it to bee nothing elſe but a full Night.</p>
                  <p>Theſe and ſundry ſuch like miſtakes, I conceive I have cleared, I preſum'd therefore that this inſuing Treatiſe will be heartily welcome to every tender Conſcience, that doth truly deſire to give unto the Lord his own ſeparated and ſanctified time.</p>
                  <p>Many godly Chriſtians, to my knowledge, have been much exerciſed in their Studies, and Meditations, to finde out the true limits of the Lords Day, that ſo they might abſtain from the works of their particular Calling, in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very part of that ſanctified and ſeparated time, from the beginning of the day to the full end thereof.</p>
                  <p>For their ſakes alſo, and at the ſpecial requeſt of ſome of them, I have laboured in this Treatiſe, to prove, That all the time of the firſt Darkneſſe was comprehended in the word Morning at laſt, and that it took its beginning from the Mid-night at laſt, namely, as ſoon as all the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parts of the Natural day were ſhaped and ſet into their order.</p>
                  <p>And therefore the beginning of the Morning from the time of Mid-night muſt not be aſcribed to the <hi>Romans,</hi> as the firſt Authors of it (as many unadviſedly do,) no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:44298:83"/>
from the very firſt created day; and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently it muſt needs be the true beginning of the Jews Sabbath.</p>
                  <p>This Tenent may happily ſeem ſtrange at the firſt, to ſuch as have long held, both in their judgement and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, That the Jews Sabbath (and ſo conſequently the Lords Day) did properly begin at the Sun-ſet evening; and of this judgement and practice are moſt of the Churches in <hi>New England,</hi> and in that reſpect many Profeſſors among them do without ſcruple take liberty in the Sun-ſet Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Lords Day, to do the ſervile works of their particular Callings, and others take liberty to uſe Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>But it is worthy to be taken notice of, that whole Churches do many times erre, both in their judgement and practice, or elſe how could ſo much Corruption, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, Idolatry, and Prophaneneſſe creep in to ſeveral reformed Churches, as there hath done from time to time in ſundry ages?</p>

                        <p>And indeed there could not be a compleat night at firſt, not untill the Artificial day was firſt compleatly formed by the ſhining out of the light twelve houres together, and then at the end of the ſaid twelve houres the light went out of that horizon, and then there ſucceeded another darkneſſe of twelve Houres which began with a Twilight. The firſt halfe of this darkneſſe made up the firſt darkneſſe to be a compleat night

of twelve houres; and the other halfe went on towards the beginning of the ſecond natural day.</p>
                        <p>And thus, after this order and manner the firſt night was created, ſhaped and limited, with a double Twilight, and by this means it became a true pattern and ſampler to all the other Creation nights.</p>

                        <p>The ſumme of what I have ſaid, may be drawn up into this Syllogiſm.</p>
                        <p>No Darkneſſe that wants the true ſhape and form of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat night, can be called a compleat night.</p>
                        <p>But the firſt Darkneſſe wanted the true ſhape and form of a compleat night, becauſe it wanted a Twilight in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, which is an inſeparable adjunct to the true ſhape and form of a compleat night.</p>
                        <p>Therefore the firſt Darkneſſe cannot in proper ſpeech be called a compleat night.</p>
                        <p>The Propoſition is ſo clear that I need not prove it, becauſe no man I thinke will deny it.</p>
                        <p>The Aſſumption is thus proved, God made the Stars to rule in the night, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 17. And the Stars were ſet firſt into their dominion in the Twilight Evening of the fourth day, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 17. in reſpect whereof <hi>Job</hi> doth call them the Stars of the Twilight, <hi>Job</hi> 3. 9. But the Seventy Tranſlators call them the Stars of the night, becauſe they held <hi>Jobs</hi> Twilight to be a true part of the night; And <hi>Solomon</hi> doth likewiſe make the Twilight of the Evening to be a terme <hi>ſynonimous</hi> with Darkneſſe, and with the night, <hi>Prov.</hi> 7. 9. And <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> on <hi>Exod.</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For the further proof of this, I refer you to Chapter 4. To my Anſwer to the ſecond Objection.</p>
                        <p>But I will hereunto adde the deſcription of a compleat night, which may further enlighten this truth. <note place="margin">A compleat night is the ab<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </p>
                        <p>A compleat night is the abſence of the Suns ſhining from off the face of the earth for the ſpace of twelve houres, when the Sun is in the Equinoctial, as the dayes were in the firſt Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: This deſcription of the Night agrees with the teſtimony of <hi>Aben Ezra,</hi> immediately cited.</p>
                        <p>Object. Why doe you ſet out the ſhape and form of the firſt Artificial day by the ſhining of the Sunne, and of the Night by the abſence of the Suns ſhining? Seeing the Sunne was not created till the fourth day; It is likely that the light that was created the firſt day did not then rule the day after the ſame manner as the Sun did on the fourth day.</p>

                           <hi>Anſ.</hi> Though there was no Sun-ſhine in the firſt day, yet doubtleſſe inſtead thereof the God of Nature, and the God of Order, did cauſe a certaine light to ſhine out of darkneſſe, from the Element of Fire, in the ſelfe ſame manner and order, as he cauſed the Light to doe on the Fourth Day.</p>
                        <p>At the firſt, the general matter of the Globe, called Earth, was without form, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 2. becauſe it was voyd of all ornaments for a time; in like ſort the firſt Darkneſſe was at the firſt a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed thing, and without any ſhape or form of a night, for a time; but after the ſpace of five or ſix houres God ſaid, <hi>Let there be light, and there was light,</hi> Gen. 1. 3. It were too groſſe blindneſſe, to think that God did cauſe this Light to breake out of darkneſſe all on a ſudden, like a flaſh of Lightning; no, God was now framing the Firſt Day, to be a Patterne, and Sampler to all the reſt; and therefore the God of Nature, and the God of Order, did cauſe the Light to breake out of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe by degrees, in the ſame order and manner as he cauſed the Sunne to doe on the Fourth Day, and ſo by this meanes the God of Nature did firſt create a Twilight to the firſt Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, before he cauſed the light to ſhine out upon the face of the Earth, as he did by the Sunne on the Fourth day; then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo he cauſed the Light to aſcend by degrees, until it came to its height at mid-day, and then he cauſed it to decline by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:44298:91"/>
until it went off from that Horizon, as the Sunne doth now; and ſo by this meanes the Artificial Day was compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhaped, and formed, before the whole Night could be ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped and formed.</p>
                        <p>But ſecondly, When the Artificial Day was thus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> formed, by the ſhining of the Light twelve houres, then there ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded another Twilight, and twelve houres Darkneſſe more then the firſt Darkneſſe; the firſt halfe of that twelve houres darkneſſe made up the firſt darkneſſe a compleat night of twelve houres, with a double Twilight, and ſo it became a true patterne and ſampler to all other Creation Nights, and then the laſt halfe of the ſaid twelve houres darkneſſe went on towards the beginning of the Second Day.</p>
                        <p>And except this order be obſerved, there cannot be found out a double Twilight to make the firſt Night a compleat pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne for all the other Creation nights.</p>

                        <p>It is evident that the firſt Darkneſſe was not a compleat night by the order of that Dominion which God eſtabliſhed for the ruling of the Artificial Day by the Sun, before he gave Dominion to the Moon, and to the Starres, to rule the night.</p>
                        <p>But if the firſt Darkneſſe had been a full night before the Artificial day had received its ſhape and form, then the Moon and Stars ſhould have had their dominion before the Sun, for doubtleſſe the God of order would place them in their domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in the day of their creation, according to that priority of order which the day had of the night, or the night had of the day. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 14. 19.</p>
                        <p>If the night of the fourth day had been firſt in order be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Artificial day, then the Moon and the Stars ſhould have had the priority of their dominion to rule the night of the fourth day, before the Sun could have had its dominion to rule the artificial day; and ſo by this account the Sun ſhall borrow its light from the Moon as the chiefeſt in the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the fourth day: Is not this to make the God of order to be the God of confuſion, in ſetting the Cart before
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:44298:91"/>
the Horſe, by giving the firſt dominion to the Moon, and the laſt dominion to the Sun; as they do that make the firſt dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to be a compleat night.</p>
                        <p>Or elſe if you think to avoid this Rock, by ſaying that the Sun only was created on the fourth day to rule the artificiall day, and that the Moon and the Stars were not created, and ſet into their rule and dominion till the fifth night, is not this to run againſt the plain Text.

                        <p>If the firſt darkneſſe had been formed into a compleat night before the light was formed into a compleat artificiall day; Then doubtleſſe <hi>Moſes</hi> would have called it Night (as the proper name of its perfect ſhape and form) before he called the light Day: for it was Gods uſuall cuſtome to give names to things in the ſame priority of order, as they had priority of form and ſhape: As for example, As ſoon as he had made man of the earth, he called him <hi>Adam,</hi> and as ſoon as he had made woman of his Rib, he bid <hi>Adam</hi> name her; and as ſoon as he had formed other creatures, he brought them to <hi>Adam,</hi> &amp; bid him name them with names, defining their natures; &amp; ſo doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs if the firſt <hi>darknes,</hi> had been firſt form'd into a compleat <hi>night,</hi> he would have named it night in the firſt place; but he called it nothing elſe but Darkneſſe at firſt, ſaying the darkneſſe was, namely it was a miſ-ſhapen and uncreated thing: But as ſoon as he had put a ſhape, and limited it by a double Twilight, he called it night, as the name of its perfect form and ſhape: But it could not receive this ſhape and form untill the light was firſt ſhaped and formed into an artificial day by its orderly ſhining upon the face of the earth for twelve hours together, and then he called it day, as the proper name of its perfect ſhape and form.</p>
                        <p>Hence we may cleerly perceive, That <hi>Moſes</hi> in <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 5. doth name all the parts of the firſt natural day in their true pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority of order as they were ſhaped and formed, 1 Day, 2 Night, 3 Evening, 4 Morning.

                        <p>The addition of the Sun in the fourth day made no new part of Light more then the firſt day had, as I have noted it already, and therefore the manner how the Light did break out of Darkneſſe on the firſt day, was in the ſame manner and order as we ſee the Sun doth in the Equinoctial.</p>

                        <p n="6">6 Then it made a Twilight, called the Twilight of the Evening, <hi>Prov.</hi> 7. 9.</p>

                        <p n="1">1 By proving that <hi>Moſes</hi> in <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 5. divided the firſt natural day into two equall parts two ſeveral wayes, as I have exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified it by the lines of longitude and latitude on a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe Diall in <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. and ſee alſo the gradations to the morning in <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. at Sixthly.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 I anſwer by proving that <hi>Gnereb</hi> the Evening is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion of the latter halfe of the artificial day to the firſt halfe of the Night, and ſo making it to be an equall part of time to <hi>Boker</hi> the Morning. But the beſt way to anſwer this, and many
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:44298:93"/>
other Objections, is to lay downe the true interpretation of <hi>Gnereb,</hi> the Evening, in the various uſe of it in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                        <p>I am not ignorant that <hi>Gnereb</hi> is uſually interpreted to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie <note place="margin">The Hebrew word Gnereb, which is tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated Evening, in Gen. 1. 5. explained.</note> a mixing, or mingling of things together; but I diſlike this interpretation, becauſe it is not poſſible by this interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to find out the true form, &amp; ſhape of the Natural Evening, I have therefore made diligent ſearch into the various uſe of this word, and I finde that <hi>Gnereb</hi> doth ſignifie (not a confuſed mixing and mingling of things together, but) a connexing, conjoyning, or coupling of two or more diſtinct things toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, without confounding their ſeverall ſpecies, or natures, and therefore Wine and Water mixed together cannot be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Gnereb,</hi> neither can the confuſed mingling of Light and Darkneſſe together (as it is in the Twilight) be called <hi>Gne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reb,</hi> and yet that ſhort time of Twilight is comprehended within the large limits of <hi>Gnereb,</hi> becauſe it is the partition of <hi>(Gnarbaiim)</hi> the two Evenings; but the Twilight it ſelfe is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver expreſſed by two other ſeverall Hebrew words, and never by <hi>Gnereb.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The thing I ayme at in this Diſcourſe is only to clear the true ſignification of <hi>Gnereb,</hi> from a confuſed mixing or ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of things together, and to make it clear and evident, that it only ſignifies a conjunction of two or more diſtinct things together, and therefore that <hi>Gnereb</hi> in <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 5. muſt ſignifie the conjunction of the laſt halfe of the Artificiall day to the firſt halfe of the Night, and that theſe two diſtinct parts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed are an even and equal portion of time to <hi>Boker,</hi> the morning.</p>
                        <p>2. I wil explaine the true meaning of this phraſe in <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 5. ſo was the Evening, and ſo was the Morning. Firſt mark the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence; in the former part of the Verſe, it is ſaid, <hi>God called the light Day, and the darkneſſe he called Night;</hi> and then it follows, ſo was the Evening; but how was that? was it framed out of the darkneſſe only? No, it was framed and formed both out of the ſaid Light called Day, and out of the ſaid Darkneſſe cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Night, <hi>Conjunctim,</hi> and not <hi>Diviſim,</hi> namely, the Evening was framed by conjoyning the latter halfe of the Artificiall
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:44298:94"/>
day to the firſt halfe of the Night; and ſo was the Morning, namely, it was in like ſort framed out of the Darkneſſe called Night, and out of the Light called Day, by conjoyning the laſt halfe of the Night to the firſt halfe of the Artificiall day: and it is moſt evident that this was the true meaning of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;</hi> becauſe he doth afterwards explaine <hi>Gnereb</hi> the ſingle Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, by <hi>Gnarbaiim</hi> the two Evenings eleaven times over, and the reaſon is, becauſe the ful Natural evening hath two parts; namely the firſt halfe is Day, and the latter halfe is Night, as I ſhal open the matter more at large, both in this Chapter by and by, and in Chapter the fiſt.</p>
                        <p>And from this interpretation of <hi>Gnereb,</hi> in <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 5. theſe three Concluſions do follow.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 That the Firſt Darkneſſe is not, nor cannot be called <hi>Gnereb</hi> the Evening.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 That the whole Night is not, nor cannot be called <hi>Gne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reb</hi> the Evening, in a proper ſenſe.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 That the Twilight cannot be called <hi>Gnereb</hi> the Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
                        <p>And the reaſon is, becauſe none of theſe three have any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct conjunction of ſpecies to make them <hi>Gnereb;</hi> and from this interpretation of <hi>Gnereb</hi> I frame this Argument.</p>
                        <p>The firſt Darkneſſe by it ſelfe conſidered cannot be called <hi>Gnereb</hi> the Evening, neither can the confuſed mixture of the Twilight be called <hi>Gnereb</hi> the Evening, becauſe <hi>Gnereb</hi> doth ſignifie (not ſuch a mixture as is confuſed, but) a connexing, or conjoyning of two or more things together, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding their diſtinct ſpecies; and there are no other di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct ſpecies in <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 5. to be conjoyned together, but the Light called Day, and the Darkneſſe called Night.</p>
                        <p>But the firſt darkneſſe was pure darkneſſe, and no other thing was connexed to it til the Light was created, and that connexion though at the firſt it might have been called <hi>Gnereb,</hi> yet now it muſt not be called <hi>Gnereb,</hi> becauſe it pleaſed Good to call it <hi>Boker,</hi> the morning.</p>
                        <p>Therefore the firſt Darkneſſe by it ſelfe conſidered, cannot be called <hi>Gnereb</hi> the Evening, neither was it framed into any part of the Evening at all.</p>

In the Evening time it ſhall be light; the alluſion is moſt fit and proper to the firſt Evening, which doth alwaies begin at Mid-day, at the firſt declining of the Sun, and then the Sun is in its greateſt ſtrength both for light and heat; and then Chriſt Jeſus appeared to <hi>Paul</hi> for his converſion, that he might ſend him among the Gentiles that ſate in darkneſſe, <hi>to open their eyes, and to turn them from darkneſſe to light, and from the power of Satan to God, Act.</hi> 22. 6, 14. <hi>Act.</hi> 26. 13, 18. and he made the word of God to abound through a great part of the world, even from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to <hi>Illiricum, Rom.</hi> 15. 19. In this evening time of the world, the Goſpel did ſhine in its ful ſtrength, for now Chriſt and his twelve Apoſtles, and ſeventy Diſciples, and divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prophets and Teachers, did confirme their doctrine with ſigns and wonders, to the converſion of many ten thouſand ſoules that formerly ſate in darkneſſe under the power of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan.</p>

                        <p>Theſe two Evenings were famouſly known to all the Jewes in <hi>Egypt;</hi> for when <hi>Moſes</hi> commanded them to kill the Paſſeover between the two Evenings, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 6. he did not explain what he meant by the two Evenings, he did not make any circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall deſcription of them, which had been neceſſary if they had not been familiarly acquainted with the ſeveral limits of them; but he doth onely barely name them as a thing that was familiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known to them.</p>

                        <p>His meaning is according to other Hebrew Doctors, namely, that the Evening of the Suns declining, begins at the firſt declin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Sun at Mid-day, and that the Evening of the Suns ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting doth begin then.</p>
                        <p>And <hi>Buxtorfius</hi> in his Hebrew Lexicon upon the word <hi>Gnar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baiim</hi> doth cite other Hebrew Canons to this very purpoſe; But I ſhall refer you to Chap. 5. for a further deſcription of the two Evenings, where I explaine the Paſſeover Evening.</p>
                        <p>I have already cited nine places of Scripture, where the term of two Evenings is cited in the Hebrew text, and now I will cite two places more: The Prieſts were commanded to light up their Lamps between the two Evenings, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30. 8. and the Quailes came between the two Evenings, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. 12. Alſo I find one clear example of the two Evenings in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in one and the ſame day; It is ſaid in <hi>Matth.</hi> 14. 15. <hi>When it was evening the Diſciples came to him and ſaid, the time is now paſt</hi> (that is to ſay, it is now paſt dinner time) <hi>ſend the multitude a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way;</hi> But Chriſt did not ſend them away untill he had firſt made them dine, and after they had well dined, then he ſent them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way<hi>:</hi> After this Evening Chriſt went up into a mountain to pray, and then it is ſaid againe, <hi>When the Evening was come, bee was there alone,</hi> ver. 23. This Evening in ver. 23. is another Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning beſides that in verſ. 15. and between theſe two Evenings Chriſt did a long action, for he fed many thouſands plentifully; And thus I have proved by a Jury of twelve Witneſſes that the naturall Evening is divided into two Evenings, and I have ſet out the limits of the firſt Evening by the teſtimony of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Doctors from Mid-day till Sun-ſet, and the latter Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing begins at Sun-ſet, and ends at mid-night, and both theſe Evenings are called <hi>Gnarbaiim</hi> in the duall number; that is ſay, the Twy-party Evening; for ſo <hi>Gnarbaiim</hi> in the duall number muſt be underſtood, as it appears by the like form of ſpeech, where the Scripture ſetteth out the twy-party connexture of other things, as for example, <hi>Ramath</hi> in mount <hi>Ephraim,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 19.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:44298:99"/>
is called <hi>Ramothaim</hi> in the dual number, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 1. ſome Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators render it the two <hi>Ramaths</hi> in mount <hi>Ephraim,</hi> but indeed they are deceived, for there is but one <hi>Ramath</hi> in Mount <hi>Ephraim,</hi> and that <hi>Ramath</hi> is called <hi>Ramothaim</hi> in the dual number, becauſe it had two parts, and ſo <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is uſually called <hi>Jeruſalaim</hi> in the duall number, 2 <hi>Sam</hi> 5. 6, 7. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 18. not becauſe there were two <hi>Jeruſalems,</hi> but becauſe the City <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> had two principal parts; for firſt, There was the City of the people on the one part; and ſecondly, There was the City of <hi>David</hi> and mount <hi>Zion</hi> on the other part; but neither of theſe parts alone could properly be called the City of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but both parts muſt be put together to make up the full City <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and in this reſpect it might well be called the double <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> or the twy-party <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> the like may be ſaid of <hi>Ramothaim,</hi> for there was but one City in Mount <hi>Ephraim</hi> that was called <hi>Ramath,</hi> as verſ. 19. tels us, But this City was called <hi>Ramothaim</hi> in the duall number, becauſe it had two principall parts. Firſt, There was the City of the people on the one part; And ſecondly, There was <hi>Naioth</hi> in <hi>Ramath</hi> on the other part where the High place was, and where <hi>Samuel</hi> dwelt, and kept a Prophets School, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19. 18, 19. But neither of theſe parts could properly be called the full City <hi>Ramath,</hi> but both of them together did make up the full City <hi>Ramath.</hi> So alſo <hi>Diblath, Ezek.</hi> 6. 14. is <hi>Diblathaim, Jerm.</hi> 48. 22. And ſo <hi>Gnereb</hi> the Evening is ſometimes called <hi>Gnarbaiim</hi> the two Evenings, but neither of thoſe two Evenings taken a part can properly be called <hi>Gnereb</hi> the full naturall Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as it is meant in <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 5. but both of them put together do make up the full natural Evening; and in this reſpect <hi>Gnarbaiim</hi> may be tranſlated the twofold evening or the twy-party evening, as well as the two Evenings, becauſe indeed there is but one na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Evening, which is divided by the time of Sunſet into two principall parts. It is therefore but a woodden ſhift of ſome Scholars to call the firſt Evening an improper Evening, and to call the latter Evening onely the full naturall Evening: The like woodden ſhift it is to make no other part of time to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Gnereb</hi> properly, but the very beginning of the Night, or of the later Evening onely, as ſome do interpret <hi>Junius</hi> Annotation on <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 5. to ſpeak.</p>
                        <p>2. If the Holy Spirit had framed <hi>Gnarbaiim,</hi> to ſet out both a
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:44298:100"/>
proper and an improper Evening with one and the ſame voice and breath, then doubtleſſe the ſeventy Tranſlators being He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew <note place="margin">The ſeventy Interpreters do make the two Evenings to be but one proper Evening.</note> Doctors would have found it out, and then they would have deſcribed the various acceptation of the word, by ſome marke of diſtinction or other, eſpecially conſidering they took liberty to vary the terme of their tranſlation from <hi>Gnarbaiim,</hi> for they do never fully expreſſe the term <hi>Gnarbaiim</hi> the two Evenings in any place, but nine times over they tranſlate it by the ſingle term Evening, and therefore if they had accounted the firſt part of it to have been an improper Evening, and the latter part onely proper, then doubtleſſe they would ſomewhere or other have given ſome mark of diſtinction whereby to know them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder, eſpecially ſeeing they take liberty to alter the phraſe; But it ſeems to me they accounted both the parts of <hi>Gnarbaiim</hi> to be but one proper naturall Evening, becauſe they do nine times over tranſlate <hi>Gnarbaiim</hi> by the ſingle term Evening. I confeſſe they doe once after a ſort ſet out the two parts of <hi>Gnarbaiim</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 23. 5. for there the Seventy read the Text thus. In the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth day of the month, between the middle of thoſe things that belong to the Evening; in this tranſlation they doe not fully name the two Evenings, but yet after a ſort they doe name the two Evenings, becauſe they ſay between the middle of thoſe things that belong to the Evening; their meaning muſt be this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In the beginning of the Paſſeover Evening, they in the firſt place did offer the daily evening Sacrifice, burne Incenſe, trim the Lamps, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Secondly, As ſoon as the latter evening was come (which did alwaies begin at Sun-ſet) they began to feaſt upon the fleſh of their Paſſeovers, and of their Peace-offerings, in a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn religious manner<hi>:</hi> Now between, or in the middle of theſe things all their Paſſeovers were ſacrificed. And thus by this Interpretation it appears evidently that the ſeventy Tranſlators held <hi>Gnarbaiim</hi> to be but one proper naturall evening divided into two princiall parts, becauſe they called that which was done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two evenings, the middle of the evening in the ſingular number. Therefore I may well conclude, that their diſtinction is abſurd, that make the firſt part of <hi>Gnarbaiim</hi> to be no more but an improper evening, and that make the latter part onely proper. I think no man that is well adviſed can find any harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in the Scripture by this Interpretation.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="23" facs="tcp:44298:100"/>
3. It is alſo evident that <hi>Gnereb</hi> the Evening, is as large in length of time as <hi>Gnarbaiim</hi> the two Evenings is; for not onely <note place="margin">The Hebrew text doth make the two Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to be but one proper Evening.</note> the Seventy do tranſlate <hi>Gnarbaiim,</hi> by the ſingle term Evening; but the Hebrew Text it ſelfe doth often put <hi>Gnereb</hi> for <hi>Gnarbaiim</hi> interchangeably, as for example, four places of Scripture doe command them to offer the daily evening Sacrifice between the two evenings, but many more places ſay it ſhould be done or ſacrificed in <hi>Gnereb</hi> the evening; five places command all the Paſſeovers to be ſacrificed between the two evenings, but more places ſay it ſhall be done or ſacrificed in <hi>Gnereb</hi> the evening; one place ſaith, that the Prieſts muſt cauſe the Lamps to burne between the two evenings, but other places ſay in the evening; one place ſaith the Quailes came between the two evenings, but other places ſay they came in <hi>Gnereb</hi> the evening: Therefore <hi>Gnereb</hi> and <hi>Gnarbaiim</hi> is but one proper evening; <hi>Gnereb</hi> is as large in time as <hi>Gnarbaiim</hi> is, both parts together make up the true and proper naturall evening called <hi>Gnereb.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Hence I conclude, that the Hebrew word <hi>Gnereb</hi> doth not <note place="margin">The two parts of Gnereb ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplified.</note> ſignifie ſuch a confuſed mixture as is between light and darkneſſe in the Twilight; but it ſignifies ſuch a diſtinct connexion of Day and Night together, as may be called <hi>Gnarbaiim,</hi> the two e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venings, and ſuch a connexion as may be diſtinguiſhed or ſevered from each other into two diſtinct parts: as I may exemplifie the matter by a party-coloured coat, one half is white and the other halfe is black; ſo is <hi>Gnereb</hi> the evening, the firſt halfe is white called day, and the other halfe is black called night, and the time of Twilight that couples theſe two evenings together, may be likened to the ſeam that couples the white and black peeces to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for the compleating of the party-coloured coat. Or thus, the two parts of <hi>Gnereb</hi> may be exemplified by the cloud that ſtood between the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> and the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> the one halfe of the cloud was light towards the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and the other halfe was dark towards the <hi>Egyptians, Exod.</hi> 14. 20. So is <hi>Gnereb,</hi> the natural evening, the firſt halfe is light called day, and the other half is dark called night.</p>
                        <p>But if the naturall evening had been nothing elſe but night, as moſt Interpreters doe affirme upon <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 5. then all evening Sacrifices muſt have been offered in the night time only; but the Hebrew Doctors wil laugh that opinion to ſcorn as a foule ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity;

                        </head>
                        <p>THe firſt Scripture by which I prove that the Natural Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing doth begin at Mid-day, at the firſt declining of the Sun, is from <hi>Jeremy,</hi> whoſe ſpeech is both plain and elegant, <hi>Jeremy</hi> ſpeaks thus in the perſon of the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Souldiers, <hi>Ariſe, let us go up at noon; woe unto us, for the day declineth, and the ſhadowes of the evening are ſtretched out, Jer.</hi> 6. 4. Theſe words are ſpoken by way of alluſion; but yet two phraſes are remarkable in this Text. 1. The day declineth. 2. The ſhadowes of the evening are ſtretched out; both theſe termes are Synonima, and mean the ſame time of the day; for as ſoon as the day begins to decline, the ſhadowes of the evening begin to be ſtretched out. Hence then it follows, 1. That the evening doth begin as ſoon as the day begins to decline. 2. That the ſhadowes of the evening do begin to ſtretch themſelves as ſoon as the ſun which rules the day, doth begin firſt to decline.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Jeremy</hi> ſpeaks theſe words in the perſon of the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers who made haſte to deſtroy the Jewes by the Noon-tide, but when they were upon their march they ſaw they were like to come ſhort of the appointed time, and therefore they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:44298:101"/>
by way of Proſopopeia; yet there muſt be a reall truth in the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, I prove that the natural Evening begins at Mid-day, at the firſt declining of the Sun, by <hi>Matth.</hi> 14. 15. <hi>When the Evening was come; Luke</hi> expounds this evening to be come, when the day began to go down or decline, <hi>Luk.</hi> 9. 12. So Mr. <hi>Broughton</hi> renders the Text: And when elſe doth the day firſt begin to go down or decline, but when the Sun that rules the Day doth firſt begin to go down or decline? as is above obſerved from <hi>Jer.</hi> 6. 4. And experience doth tell us, that the Sun doth firſt begin to decline at mid-day, and that it continues declining till Sun-ſet; So then, from the term Evening in <hi>Matthew</hi> deſcribed by this adjunct in <hi>Luke,</hi> when the day begins to go down or decline, it may truly be gathered by neceſſary conſequence, that the natural evening doth begin at mid-day, at the firſt declining of the Sun; and this evening hath two parts, the firſt part begins at the firſt declining of the Sun, as I have already expounded, v. 15. and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther evening doth begin at Sun-ſet, in v. 23.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, I prove that the full natural evening begins at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, at the firſt declining of the Sun, by <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 6. <hi>Thou ſhalt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice the Paſſeover at Evening, at the going down of the Sun, at the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon thou cameſt out of</hi> Egypt. This Text is very pregnant to prove the point in queſtion; but becauſe I have occaſion to expound this Text at large in chap. 5. Therefore I refer the Reader thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, I prove that the full natural Evening begins at mid-day by 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20. 5. <hi>David</hi> doth there intreat <hi>Jonathan</hi> to meet him on the third day at Even, and it appears that <hi>Jonathan</hi> was very careful to obſerve the punctual beginning of this appointed evening, becauſe it was a matter of weight, and becauſe <hi>David</hi> depended upon his punctual obſervation of the preciſe time, therefore <hi>Jonathan</hi> did confirm his promiſe by an oath, ver. 13. beſides, <hi>David</hi> did over and above all this charge <hi>Jonathan</hi> to come to him quickly or diligently, that is to ſay, to be exact, and to keep the appointed time diligently or punctually, and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Jonathan</hi> did manifeſt his diligence to obſerve the punctual time, as it is evident, becauſe he went out into the field on the third day in the Morning, which (ſaith the Text) was <hi>at the time appointed with David,</hi> v. 35.</p>
                        <p>

Object, 4. <hi>How can you make</hi> Jonathans <hi>Morning to be the appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted time with</hi> David, <hi>ſeeing</hi> David <hi>did not appoint</hi> Jonathan <hi>to meet him on the third day in the morning, but on the third day at even, as</hi> v. 5. <hi>teſtifieth?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſw. Jonathans</hi> morning was the appointed time with <hi>David,</hi> becauſe <hi>Jonathans</hi> morning did end at mid-day, and <hi>Davids</hi> evening did begin at mid-day, at the firſt declining of the Sun: now <hi>Jonathan</hi> could not have come quickly, diligently, exactly and punctually to the place appointed at the beginning of the evening, unleſſe he went out on the third day morning, that is to ſay, a little before the evening began; but by his diligence in taking in a little peece of the morning at the beginning of his Journey, he might well be at the place appointed according to the punctuall time of the appointed Evening; and thus <hi>Jonathans</hi> Morning and <hi>Davids</hi> Evening do meet together at Mid-day, and no other reſolution can be given, as I conceive, to make <hi>Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans</hi> morning and <hi>Davids</hi> evening to agree together at one and the ſame appointed time but this.</p>
                        <p>Object. 5. <hi>Why may not the appointed evening be underſtood of the night-evening, and the appointed place be a great way off, and in that reſpect</hi> Jonathan <hi>might begin his journey in the morning, that ſo be might come to the place appointed at the time of the Sun-ſet evening?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> I perceive that men are loath to have any other evening, but the night-evening, and therefore they are willing to raiſe what Objections they can againſt the mid-day evening: But I will give you divers Reaſons why the appointed evening cannot be meant of the Sun-ſet evening.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, If the place of meeting had been ſo far off as to cauſe <hi>Jonathan</hi> to ſpend ſo much time in going thither as from morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing till Sun-ſet, then <hi>Jonathan</hi> could not have had time enough left to return back again into the City in the ſame day. But the Text in ver. 23. doth tell us that <hi>Jonathan</hi> did return the ſame day into the City; therefore the appointed evening cannot be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of the ſun-ſet evening.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, <hi>Jonathan</hi> returned alone without any company with him, for he had ſent his Boy back into the City before, which in reaſon he would not have done, if the place of meeting had been ſo far off as you make it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="27" facs="tcp:44298:102"/>
Thirdly, <hi>Jonathan</hi> knew that <hi>Saul</hi> was jealous of his famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arity with <hi>David,</hi> and he knew alſo that <hi>Saul</hi> was much inra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged againſt <hi>David</hi> at this time; Therefore in wiſdom <hi>Jonathan</hi> would not be ſo long abſent from <hi>Saul</hi> as from morning till Sun-ſet; nay, it would have been Mid-night ere he could have returned, if the place appointed to meet at had been ſo far off as you would make it, and then <hi>Saul</hi> might well have ſuſpected that <hi>Jonathan</hi> might have had ſome other errand into the field be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides ſhooting at a mark, by his long and late abſence; but <hi>Ionathan</hi> pretended no other errand but to ſhoot at a mark, and therefore he took his Boy with him to witneſſe ſo much if need ſhould be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. Hence it followes, that the place of meeting was but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle way without the City; for what need had a man goe farre to ſhoot at a Mark? and ſo it asked but a little time to goe to it, and to return from it.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 Hence it followes, that the appointed Evening muſt be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of the Mid-day Evening, and not of the Sun-ſet Evening: And thus <hi>Jonathans</hi> Morning and <hi>Davids</hi> Evening did fitly agree to the ſame appointed hour at Mid-day.</p>
                        <p>In like ſort one Evangeliſt ſaith that Chriſt was crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the third houre, <hi>Mark.</hi> 15. 25. But <hi>John</hi> ſaith he was crucified at the ſixt hour, <hi>Joh.</hi> 19. 14. this differing relation of time, may ſeem to have as great a difference as is between <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathans</hi> Morning and <hi>Davids</hi> Evening, and yet there is no differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Fifthly, I prove that the naturall Evening doth begin at Mid-day, by <hi>Joſh.</hi> 7. 6. There <hi>Joſhua</hi> and the Elders fell down up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Earth before the Ark of the Lord till Even-tide, that is to ſay until Evening began.</p>
                        <p>Object. 6. <hi>This Even-tide muſt be underſtood of the Sun-ſet Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer no, it cannot be underſtood of the Sun-ſet Evening, for <hi>Joſhua</hi> had much buſineſſe to doe after this, which muſt be done before the time of Sunſet, for the Lord comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Joſhua</hi> to ſanctifie the people againſt the morrow, Verſ. 13, 14. But <hi>Joſhua</hi> could not ſanctifie them at the Sun-ſet Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, for then the day of their cleanneſſe muſt begin, by the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the <hi>Leviticall</hi> Law; they muſt therefore be waſhed from their defilements in the afternoon, or elſe they could not begin the day of their cleanneſſe at their Sun-ſet Evening; and in caſe they did not begin the new day of their cleanneſſe at Sun-ſet, they might not come before the Lords Arke on the morrow to beg Attonement for Tranſgreſſors, as I have opened the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter more at large in Chap. 4.</p>
                        <p>Now <hi>Joſhua</hi> could not have ſanctified the people in a fit man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to come before the Lords Ark on the morrow, if he had lain ſtill upon the earth till the Even-tide at Sun-ſet; for <hi>Joſhua</hi> muſt have a large time to inform all the people by a Proclamation through all the Camp, what was the cauſe of the Lords anger, and what they muſt do by way of preparation before they could ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Lords favour<hi>:</hi> The thing they muſt do by way of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration was to ſanctifie themſelves from their Ceremonial de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filements, by waſhing their Bodies and their Cloaths according to the Ceremonial cuſtoms, as they are ſet down in <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. 10. <hi>Gen.</hi> 35. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Sixthly, I prove, That the full naturall Evening begins at Mid-day when the Afternoon begins, becauſe the Evening in Scripture is often put for the Afternoon, as the morning is put for the Forenoon: <hi>In the morning ſow thy ſeed, and in the Evening let not thy hand reſt, Eccleſ.</hi> 11. 6. <hi>Sol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>mons</hi> meaning is, that men ſhould be as diligent in doing good at all times, as the Husband-man is in ſeed-time; he will not reſt from ſowing his ſeed nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Forenoon nor afternoon, becauſe he knows not which will prove beſt. A wiſe and diligent Husband-man will go out to ſow his ſeed in the afternoon Evening, and not defer it till the Sun-ſet Evening; therefore by <hi>Solomons</hi> account the Evening be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins with the Afternoon at Mid-day.</p>
                        <p>2. It is ſaid <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90. 6. <hi>In the morning the graſſe flouriſheth and groweth up, but in the evening it is cut down and withereth:</hi> The Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman doth not uſe to go out to mow his graſſe in the evening after Sun-ſet, or if he ſometimes do ſo, yet it doth not wither in the evening after Sun-ſet; But Husbandmen uſe to take the opportunity to mow their graſſe in the afternoon, and then it withereth, therefore the Evening begins with the afternoon.</p>
                        <p>3. It is ſaid in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17. 16. that <hi>Goliah</hi> drew near Morning and Evening forty days together<hi>:</hi> But Souldiers doe not uſe to call for a Pitched Battle in the evening after Sun-ſet, but either in the Forenoon or in the Afternoon Evening.</p>
                        <p>4. It is ſaid 1 <hi>King</hi> 17. 6. That the Ravens brought bread and fleſh to <hi>Elijah</hi> morning and evening: but the Ravens do not uſe to carry meat in the evening after Sun-ſet, for then they uſe to flie to their Rooſt, and ſo to continue there all night; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Ravens carried meat to <hi>Elijah</hi> in the Afternoon Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
                        <p>Seventhly, <hi>Paul</hi> ſent for the Jews in <hi>Rome</hi> to come to his lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he might teſtifie unto them the things of the Kingdome of God, and that he might perſwade them concerning Jeſus, and they came at the day appointed, and then <hi>Paul</hi> preached unto them from morning till evening, <hi>Act.</hi> 28. 23. But I think no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate man will ſay that <hi>Paul</hi> continued his Sermon to that mixed multitude from the morning light, till the evening at Sun-ſet: The hungry bellies and captious ſpirits of moſt of theſe Jewes would not indure it; neither would <hi>Pauls</hi> wiſdom nor
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:44298:104"/>
his ſtrength ſuffer him to offer it, eſpecially ſeeing the Jewes of this Synagogue had before-hand manifeſted to <hi>Paul</hi> their diſlike of this Sect, verſ. 22.</p>
                        <p>Theſe circumſtances conſidered, this phraſe from morning till evening muſt be underſtood of a convenient portion of time for one Sermon. It is like they came to <hi>Pauls</hi> lodging at the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary houre wherein they uſed to reſort to their Synagogues, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout nine a clock in the morning, and it is like alſo that <hi>Paul</hi> continued his Sermon to them till the Noon-tide evening, a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more or leſſe, as in wiſdom he thought it convenient, all cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances conſidered, and in likelihood the Jews would not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point to meet at <hi>Pauls</hi> lodging before the ordinary hour of morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prayer, nor be contented to ſtay longer than Dinner-time, when the Evening begins, at Mid-day; therefore it may be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by probable conjecture, that the evening began at Mid-day in <hi>Rome</hi> as well as in <hi>Iudea.</hi>

                        <p>8. Then take twelve hours darkneſſe, and ſhadow out the firſt half of that Darkneſſe from the Weſt point untill it meet with the place of the firſt darkneſſe at the North point.</p>
                        <p>9. Then write upon all that Darkneſſe from the Weſt point to the Eaſt point, the name Night, as the proper name of its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſhape and limit, and in this order was the night laſt ſhaped out, limited and named.

                        <p>11. By theſe marks of diſtinction, the true Form and Figure of the two Lines of Longitude and Latitude, from Eaſt to Weſt, and from North to South, were clearly marked out.</p>
                        <p>12. By this Line of diviſion from Mid-day to Mid-night the Natural Day was again divided into two equal parts (in a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manner from the diviſion of the Day from the Night) the firſt half from Mid-day to Mid-night was called <hi>Gnereb,</hi> the Evening, and the other half from Mid-night to Mid-day was called <hi>Boker,</hi> the Morning,</p>
                        <p>13. After this ſort hath the God of Nature halſed and quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Natural day by the Lines of Longitude and Latitude.</p>
                        <p>14 By this method the God of Nature hath not only made the natural day to be a twiparty day, conſiſting of light, and darkneſs; But alſo Secondly, He hath made the Artificial Day to be a twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>party day, becauſe he hath made the one half of it to belong unto the Morning, and the other half of it to belong unto the Evening. Thirdly, He hath alſo made the Night to be a twiparty Night, becauſe he hath made the one half of it to belong unto the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the other half of it to belong unto the morning. And in this regard the night is ſometimes called nights in the plural number, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 134. 1. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 92. 2. Fourthly, He hath alſo made the Natural Evening to be a twiparty evening, becauſe it is a connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the latter half of the Day, to the firſt half of the Night; and in this reſpect it is called <hi>Gnereb,</hi> a connexion, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it is called <hi>Gnarbaiim,</hi> the two Evenings, becauſe of the two parts of it. Fifthly, He hath alſo made the Natural Morning to be a twiparty Morning, becauſe it is a connexion of the firſt dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or of the latter half of the night, with the firſt half of the Artificial day, and in this reſpect it is often called Mornings in the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:44298:106"/>
plural number, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. 14. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 101. 8. <hi>Job</hi> 7. 18. <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. 23. <hi>Iſ.</hi> 33. 2.</p>
                        <p>15. The Reaſon why the firſt darkneſſe could not be called either <hi>Boker</hi> the Morning, or <hi>Gnereb</hi> the Evening, at firſt, was, becauſe theſe names are names of the perfect ſhape and limits given unto theſe two parts of the Natural day; and the firſt dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe was a confuſed miſ-ſhapen thing at firſt, therefore it could not belong either unto the Morning or unto the Evening, until it was firſt ſhaped and limited into a night; for <hi>Boker</hi> the Morning is conſtituted of a part of the ſhaped Night, as well as of a part of the ſhaped Artificial Day; and the firſt darkneſſe could not be ſhaped into a Night until it had twelve houres darkneſſe ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Artificial Day, by means whereof the firſt half had a Twilight going before it, and then as ſoon as it met with the firſt darkneſſe at the North point, it Firſt gave perfection of ſhape to the Night. And Secondly, It gave perfection of ſhape to the Evening. And thirdly, It gave perfection of ſhape to <hi>Boker</hi> the Morning.</p>
                        <p>And accordingly, every part of this day had its name as ſoon as it had its perfect ſhape; as for example, when the ſhining light had finiſhed its laſt period at the Weſt point, it was called Day; in like ſort, when the darkneſſe had finiſhed its laſt period at the North point, it was called Night: And then alſo the Evening and the Morning was the Firſt Day.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Pharez</hi> and <hi>Zara</hi> were Twins, and when they came to their Birth, <hi>Zara</hi> thruſt out his hand firſt, thereupon the Midwife ſaid this is firſt, and ſhe did mark it out for the firſt by a red thred; yet notwithſtanding <hi>Pharez</hi> did finiſh his Birth firſt, and thereupon he was firſt named <hi>Pharez,</hi> and <hi>Zara</hi> was laſt named though he begun his Birth firſt: Even ſo, the time called Morning began its birth firſt, but yet notwithſtanding the time called Evening was firſt perfected in its ſhape and limits, and thereupon it was firſt called <hi>Gnereb.</hi>

Secondly, Early ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing may be done by advice, counſel, and meditation, as well in the time of darkneſſe, as in the morning light. Thirdly, When it pleaſed the Lord to uncreat <hi>Judab</hi> by his deſtroying Judgements (namely, by wars from the Enemy) how did God order it to be done? but by his early looking out and ſearching into things; For thus ſaith the Lord, <hi>I looked upon the Earth, and loe it was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out form and void, and to the Heavens, and they had no light,</hi> Jer. 4. 23. for by their wicked confuſed Government they had provoked the Lord by wars to turn all their Commonwealth into a Chaos a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. This form of ſpeech (by contraries) declares that God by his wiſe Providence did ſearch out in the time of the firſt dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs how to adorn the earth with light, and how to order all the parts of the firſt day in the beſt manner, and in this reſpect Gods early Providence is often ſet out by the term Morning, both in
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:44298:107"/>
regard of his early Judgements upon a people, and alſo in regard <note place="margin">Boker, the Morning, is put for Gods early ſeeking either to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or protects the godly.</note> of his early Preſervation of his own people.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. His early and ſpeedy Judgements upon the wicked are ſet out by the term Morning, in <hi>Num.</hi> 16. 5. <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3. 5. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. 14 <hi>Ezek.</hi> 7. 7, 10. and ſo in <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 10. 15.

                        <p n="2">2. The term Morning doth often denote Gods early care and Providence in looking out for the Protection of his people, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. 24. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 46. 7.</p>
                        <p>Hence I infer, that ſeeing the word Morning doth ſignifie early ſeeking, or early looking out, it may well denote unto us, that the firſt Darkneſs was not comprehended under the term Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, but under the term Morning, for <hi>Gnereb,</hi> the Evening, is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver put for early or firſt, but it is always put for late or laſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was the latter part of the Day, as I have ſhewed in my Anſwer to the third Objection of the former Chapter, and more by and by.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, It is further evident that the Morning time was firſt, <note place="margin">As Gnereb the Evening is put for laſt time<hi>:</hi> So Boker the Morning is put for the firſt time, or for the beginning of a thing.</note> and the Evening laſt, by <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. 27. <hi>Benjamin ſhall ravine like a Woolf, in the Morning he ſhall devour the prey, and in the Evening he ſhall divide the ſpoile;</hi> The Seventy render it, <hi>The early Morning;</hi> and truly, ſeeing the firſt Darkneſs had the priority of time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Artificial Morning, it is not proper to put the Artificial Morning for firſt in preheminence of time before the firſt Dark<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſs, and therefore in reaſon, the firſt Darkneſs muſt belong to the early Morning, as well as the firſt half of the Artificial Day doth, or elſe <hi>Jacob</hi> did not make a proper Alluſion to the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and to the Evening, if the firſt Darkneſs had been Evening, for then the evening had been firſt in order of time; ſearch into the ſtory of Events, and ſee how <hi>Jacobs</hi> Prophecie doth relate to the term Morning and Evening; the event of his Prophecie lyes thus.</p>

2. In the Evening-time of the world God raiſed up <hi>Paul</hi> of <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin</hi> to divide the ſpoil with the other Apoſtles, by the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel, for <hi>Paul</hi> is ſaid to make the Word of God to abound from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to <hi>Illyricum, Rom.</hi> 15. 19. and it is further evident that the daies of the Goſpel are called the Evening, by <hi>Zeph.</hi> 2. 7. the Prophet doth there foretel that there ſhall be a rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the Jews (namely of the diſperſed Jews dwelling in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Countries) that ſhall be called to reſt or lie down in the Evening, and to this remnant of diſperſed Jewes did <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>James</hi> write in the Evening-time of the Goſpel to exhort them to reſt and repoſe their Souls in Chriſt for Life and Salvation.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Zachary</hi> alſo doth uſe the term Evening for the laſt times, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for the daies of the Goſpel, and in that reſpect the time of the Goſpel is often called the laſt dayes, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2. 2. <hi>Jer.</hi> 30. 24. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 2. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 5. 20. <hi>Zacharies</hi> phraſe runs thus, <hi>In the Evening time it ſhall be light, Zach.</hi> 14. 7. It is very ſuitable to compare the laſt daies of the Goſpel to the Evening, becauſe it is the laſt half of the Natural Day; and it is moſt ſuitable alſo to compare the light of the Goſpel to the light of the Evening, for the Evening begins at Mid-day at the firſt declining of the Sun, and then the day is moſt clear and bright, and ſo it continues till almoſt Sun-ſet; and in the laſt days, when the Apoſtles had a Commiſſion to preach the Goſpel in all the world, the Goſpel gave a light moſt clear to many ſouls that ſat in darkneſs: But if the Evening had been no other time but the dark Night, as the moſt would have it, then <hi>Zacharies</hi> Alluſion to the light of that Evening, had been but a poor compariſon to ſet forth the light of the Goſpel, for in ſuch an Evening there is no other light but Star-light, or Moon-light at the beſt, and that is but a poor light to illuſtrate the light of the Goſpel by, in the days of the Apoſtles.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, As the Evening is often put for laſt, ſo the Morning is put for firſt, in <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 21. <hi>The man Gabriel whom I had ſeen in a viſion at Firſt,</hi> or in the Morning, ſo the Hebrew ſpeaks.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, It is evident by another Alluſion that the Morning is before the Evening, becauſe the term Morning is put for the very firſt beginning of a thing; and in this ſenſe <hi>Iſaiah</hi> is moſt elegant, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 47. 11. Evill ſhall come upon thee (O <hi>Babylon)</hi> and thou ſhalt not know the morning thereof (or the beginning thereof.) The Hebrew word ſignifies the early Morning; but the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:44298:108"/>
                           <hi>Geneva</hi> doth render it the Beginning; and by this phraſe the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt did (by a Periphraſis) deſcribe the beginning of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons</hi> ruin by the early Morning.</p>
                        <p>Object. 2. <hi>Good Divines do take the term Morning here for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Artificial Day, and the word Morning in that ſenſe doth not hinder, but that the firſt Darkneſs was Evening.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> I have already anſwered this Objection immediately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. I told you there, that if the firſt Darkneſs had been called Evening, then doubtleſs the Evening would have been put for the firſt beginning of any thin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>, and the Morning for laſt, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Morning is put for the firſt beginning of a thing, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is out of all doubt to me, that the firſt Darkneſs did belong to the Morning and not to the Evening.</p>
                        <p>2. I anſwer further, that the Morning of <hi>Babylons</hi> fall cannot be ſo conveniently compared to the Morning of the Artificial day, as to the dark early morning; becauſe the Artificial Morning is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent and perſpicuous to all men: But the ruin of <hi>Babylon</hi> was not perſpicuous at firſt, but it was carryed on in a ſpeedy and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure manner by the <hi>Perſians,</hi> ſo that the <hi>Babylonians</hi> had no ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition or diſcerning of their fall as yet; therefore the Morning of the Artificial Day was not ſo ſuitable to exemplifie the manner of their ſpeedy ruin, as the early dark Morning was, for it was done ſpeedily ere they were aware, <hi>Jer.</hi> 50. 24. as it appears by theſe two conſiderations.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>Iſay</hi> did foretel that <hi>Babylon</hi> ſhould be deſtroyed in the Night, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 21. 4.</p>

                        <p>Put both theſe Prophetical alluſions together, and then they wil amount to thus much, that <hi>Babylon</hi> ſhould be deſtroyed in that Morning, that begins in the Night; and the Hiſtory of Events doth tell us, not onely that <hi>Belſhazzer</hi> was ſlain in the Night, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5. 30. but alſo it is apparent by the circumſtances of time that muſt be ſpent at that drunken feaſt before that <hi>Daniel</hi> could be ſought out and brought in, to interpret the viſion, that it was in the latter part of the Night, after the Morning was begun.</p>
                        <p>Take the early Morning of <hi>Babylons</hi> fall either in the former fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurative ſenſe, or in the laſt proper ſenſe (either way or both wayes) and it doth ſufficiently prove, that the time called Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

was firſt in order before the time called Evening, or elſe this Alluſion of <hi>Babylons</hi> fall to the early Morning had been improper; hence it follows, that the firſt Darkneſs was comprehended under the term Morning, and not under the term Evening.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, <hi>Boker,</hi> the morning, is put for the firſt beginning of a <note place="margin">Fifthly, Boker, the morning, is put for the Sun-ſet Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, becauſe the time of Sun-ſet is the firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Jews day of cleanneſſes.</note> thing, becauſe it is put for the firſt beginning of the Jews Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial day (or for the Sun-ſet Evening) as the Hebrew Doctors do witneſs. See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 4. This I have further opened in another place; and ſo in like ſort <hi>Macar,</hi> the morrow, is put for the firſt beginning of the Jews Ceremonial day (or for the Sun-ſet Evening) in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30. 17. and in <hi>Lev.</hi> 23. 15. as it is further opened in chap. 4.</p>
                        <p>Sixthly, It is evident that the morning was before the time called Evening by the title that <hi>Job</hi> gives to the Angels, he cals them <hi>Morning-Stars, Job</hi> 38. 6, 7. Theſe Morning-Stars cannot be meant of the Stars in the Firmament, for they were not created till the fourth day, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 14. But theſe Morning-Stars are ſaid to ſhout and ſing when the foundation of the earth was laid; Hence it follows, that the Angels are called Morning-Stars, either becauſe of the time wherein they ſhouted at the firſt laying of the foundations of the earth, which was done in the time of the firſt darkneſs, or elſe in relation to the time of their Creation, which was alſo done in the time of the firſt darkneſs, as many learned do accord.</p>
                        <p>But if the time of their Creation, or the time wherein they ſhouted at the laying of the foundations of the earth had been Evening, then the Angels ſhould more properly have been called Evening-Stars, than Morning-Stars.</p>
                        <p>Object. 3. <hi>The Angels are called Morning-Stars, not in relation to the time of their Creation, but by way of alluſion to the excellency of their Nature, and this is more ſuitable to be expreſſed by the light of the Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial morning, than by the firſt darkneſs.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> If the Circumſtances of Gods diſcourſe with <hi>Job,</hi> and of Gods Interrogations be well marked, there is no ground to ſay that God did onely intend to ſet out the excellent nature of the Angels by comparing them to the morning of the Artificiall day.</p>
                        <p>For the main thing that God aimed at by his Interrogations to <hi>Job,</hi> was, to make him ſee his folly in deſiring to diſpute the cauſe of his afflictions with God, God ſhews him that he is not able to
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:44298:109"/>
find out the depths of his Wiſdom in the firſt laying of the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the earth, becauſe it made the Angels to ſhout out with admiration, and therefore <hi>Job</hi> was much leſs able to ſearch out the reaſon of his dealings with him, in his preſent afflictions, and in that reſpect God did poſe him with this Interrogation, <hi>Where waſt thou when I laid the foundation of the earth, tell, if thou have underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</hi> Job 38. 4, 5, 6. <hi>When the morning Stars rejoyced together, and when the Sons of God ſhouted,</hi> Ver. 7. The Text doth plainly call them Morning Stars, not ſo much in regard of the excellency of their Nature, but in regard of the time wherein they were created, or wherein they ſhouted at the excellency of Gods Workmanſhip when the foundation of the earth was laid, either way or both waies do aſſure us that the time of the firſt darkneſs was called Morning and not Evening. And that is the thing that I aim at in this firſt Section of this Chapter.</p>

                        <head>SECT. 2. <hi>Proving that the Morning doth begin in the dark Night.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>FIrſt, No man can deny but that the Morning is begun when the morning Watch is begun, for the text doth affirm it, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. 24. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. 11. And it is a known thing, that among the Jews they did alwaies begin it juſt three hours after Midnight, not onely in the Summer time but alſo in the Winter time: Hence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that their morning Watch in the time of Winter muſt needs begin in the dark night, not onely in <hi>Judea,</hi> but alſo in all the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitable parts of the world.</p>
                        <p>2. Hence it follows, that ſeeing the morning Watch did begin at three hours after Mid-night, then it will follow, that it muſt end juſt three hours after Mid-day; for in common reaſon the morning muſt be as long as the evening, namely, twelve hours long, or elſe the Evening may better be called an Unevening, then an Evening to the Morning; but none that have their ſenſes will ſay that the morning doth continue till three hours after Mid-day.</p>
                        <p>3 Hence it follows, that it is more agreeable to Scripture and to common reaſon to begin the natural morning at the marked time of Mid-night, rather than three hours after, eſpecially ſeeing it is then as dark all the winter long as it is at Mid-night, and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:44298:110"/>
therefore ſeeing the morning is begun with darkneſs, why not with darkneſs at mid-night, as well as at three hours after mid-night, ſeeing the world was created in the Equinoctial, and the Morning is then as dark at three hours after Mid-night, as it is at Mid-night?</p>
                        <p>Secondly, <hi>Ruth</hi> lay at the feet of <hi>Boaz</hi> until the Morning, <hi>Ruth.</hi> 3. 14. and yet ſhe aroſe before one could know another. Hence it is evident that it was Morning in the time of Barly Harveſt, whiles it was yet dark; it may be it was now in the end of our <hi>March,</hi> or in the beginning of our <hi>April;</hi> and though ſome ſay that the Morning Watch was not ſo called from the firſt hour of it, but from the laſt hour of it when it begun to be day light; yet this place of <hi>Ruth</hi> cals it Morning whiles it was yet dark, and before one could know another.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, It is ſaid that Chriſt aroſe in the Morning <hi>a great while before Day</hi> (or greatly in the Night) ſo the Greek ſpeaks, <hi>Mar.</hi> 1. 35. Hence it is manifeſt that it was Morning, whiles it was greatly or much in the night.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, None can deny but that the morning is begun at the time of day-break in all the Inhabited Countries of the world. Hence it follows, that then it is morning in ſome Countries near unto mid-night, eſpecially when the daies are at the longeſt; and known experience doth tell us that in the North parts of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> the day doth ſometimes begin to break near unto mid-night; and indeed the day-light (when the daies are at the longeſt) is ſcarſe ever out of the Sky in thoſe parts, except a little while a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout mid-night; Hence it follows, that ſeeing it is day-break ſometimes near unto Mid-night, then why may not the morning begin at mid-night all the year long as well in one Country as in another, ſeeing the God of Nature hath ſet ſuch an eminent mark upon mid-night, and upon mid-day, which doubtleſs was to ſet out the bounds and limits of the Natural morning, and of the evening?</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, Both Scripture and experience doth tell us that there is a certain Star called the Morning Star, which at ſome time of the year is ſeen to ariſe not long after Mid-night, and all men call it morning as ſoon as that Star is riſen, and in ſome parts when the daies are at the longeſt it riſeth near unto Mid-night, but it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies riſeth before it is day break.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="43" facs="tcp:44298:110"/>
Sixthly, It is evident that the morning begins in the dark night, by this phraſe in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. 3. <hi>The womb of the early Morning;</hi> I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe not to meddle with the myſtical ſenſe of theſe words, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it concerns not the Argument in hand; but I will onely meddle with the phraſe, for the phraſe ſake onely; for this phraſe muſt have ſome proper alluſion to ſome natural truth: <hi>Mibſchar,</hi> we tranſlate Morning, but ſaith Mr. <hi>Ainſworth</hi> the letter <hi>M</hi> is a Prepoſition, ſignifying <hi>[From</hi> or <hi>Before]</hi> and in that reſpect ſome tranſlators do render the text thus, <hi>Before the womb of the early Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;</hi> this phraſe muſt have an alluſion to ſome proper truth, and I can find nothing that may ſo fitly be called the womb of the early Morning, as the firſt darkneſs was, for out of this darkneſs God created the morning light, and in this reſpect the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning may well be divided into ſeveral degrees of time.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 The firſt Darkneſs was the womb of the Morning light.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 From the womb of the morning proceeded the Son of the morning, called the morning Star, as ſoon as it was created, and it is now called the Son of the morning, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 14. 12.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Then follows the aſcending of the morning or day-break, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 24, 26.</p>
                        <p n="4">4 Then follows the time of killing the morning Sacrifice, namely, when the face of all the Eaſt is inlightned, which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween day-break and Sun-riſing, See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Num.</hi> 28. 4. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is that the morning Sacrifice was not onely ſlain, but alſo offered before Sun-riſing, (becauſe the Meat Offering which was alwaies offered after the Burnt Offering) was offered before Sun riſing, as it appears by 2 <hi>King.</hi> 3. 20, 22. and the Burnt Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering was alwaies firſt, <hi>Lev.</hi> 1. and then the Meat Offering, <hi>Lev.</hi> 2. now though the Morning Sacrifice was offered before Sun-riſing, yet the Evening Sacrifices of all ſorts muſt be offered before Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet. For the Hebrew Doctors ſay, that after Sun-ſet the blood of all Sacrifices became unlawful, See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 1. 6. 9.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Then follows the morning of the Artificiall day at Sun-riſing, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104. 22, 23. for God did appoint the Sun to rule and limit the Artificiall day, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. Then followed the time of morning Prayer at the third hour of the day, namely at our nine a clock.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, By theſe gradations to the morning we may ſee the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their opinion that hold no other time to be called the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

properly, but a point of time onely, at the beginning of the Artificial day, all the reſt they ſay is called the morning impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, By theſe gradations to the morning it is evident that the firſt darkneſs was the root or womb of the morning, and therefore at laſt it was called Morning.</p>
                     </div>
                     <div n="3" type="section">
                        <head>SECT. 3. <hi>Proving that the Morning in all likelihood doth begin at mid-night, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the former certain grounds from the exact beginning and ending of the Evening.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>FIrſt, I will endeavor to prove that the morning doth begin at mid-night by an argument drawn from <hi>Job</hi> 26. 7. compared with <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 2. <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, That <hi>God ſtretcheth out the North upon the empty;</hi> and ſaith <hi>Moſes, The Earth was empty and void,</hi> namely, as long as darkneſs was upon the face of the deep; But as ſoon as the light was created, the earth could not be ſaid to be empty and void any longer, for then the deep was adorned with the light as with a moſt glorious ornament.</p>
                        <p>Object. 4. <hi>The firſt Darkneſs did continue twelve hours upon the face of the deep, after the general matter called Earth was created: Or thus, how long was the Earth empty and void before the light was created?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> The anſwer is from <hi>Job,</hi> That the Earth was empty and void all the ſpace of time that the North point is ſtretched out upon a Compaſs Dial, namely, the ſpace of ſix hours, for the North point on a Compaſs Dial doth ſtretch it ſelf out untill it meet with the beginning of the Eaſt point, the four ends of the two Lines of Longitude and Latitude do make the four Cardinal Points of the Compaſs, North, Eaſt, South, and Weſt: Hence it follows, that the North point is ſtretched out to the Eaſt point, and that is juſt ſix hours by the Compaſs Dyal, and ſo long ſaith <hi>Job</hi> the Globe was empty; but as ſoon as God created Light out of Darkneſs, which began to appear by degrees, firſt, By a Twi-light, and then ſhined forth at the Eaſt point, then the Earth was no longer empty and void, but it was adorued with the light.</p>
                        <p>If any man can give a better Interpretation, for the ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the North upon the Empty, I ſhall bee glad to ſee it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="45" facs="tcp:44298:111"/>
But if the firſt Darkneſs had been twelve hours long, then <hi>Job</hi> ſhould have ſaid, that God ſtretched out the Weſt point, as well as the North point upon the Empty: but <hi>Job</hi> doth not ſay ſo, but only that he ſtretched out the North upon the Empty, and therefore it follows,</p>
                        <p n="1">1 That the firſt Darkneſs was not twelve hours, but only ſix hours long upon the face of the deep, before the light was cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 Hence it follows, that the firſt half of that twelve hours Darkneſs that ſucceeded the Artificial Day, did make up the firſt darkneſs to be a juſt Night of twelve hours, and after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner both theſe parts of Darkneſs did meet together at the North point, as I have exemplified the matter upon a Compaſs Dyal, and the North Land in <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 8. may according to the Hebrew be read from the Land of darkneſs.</p>
                        <p>And why elſe doth the Prophet in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. 12. begin the time of the firſt Creation in order from the North point, but to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber us, where, and how long the darkneſs did continue upon the face of the deep after the Earth was created, before the light was created?</p>
                        <p>And ſo likewiſe for this Reaſon, <hi>Job</hi> doth teach us in what order we muſt place the four ends of the two Lines of Latitude and Longitude (now called the foure Cardinall Points of the Compaſs) by placing a man in this order to view the Globe.</p>
                        <list>
                           <item>1 He calleth the North point, the left hand.</item>
                           <item>2 He calleth the South point, the right hand.</item>
                           <item>3 He calleth the Eaſt point, before.</item>
                           <item>4 He calleth the Weſt point, behind. See <hi>Tremelius</hi> for this in <hi>Job</hi> 23. 8 9.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>So then, He that deſires to behold the Globe in a right order, how the God of Nature did divide it and quarter it, muſt place the North point of the Globe at his left hand, the Eaſt before, the South at his right hand, and the Weſt behind. See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. 13. and in <hi>Numb.</hi> 2. 3, 29.</p>
                        <p>2 The holy Scriptures do often direct us to obſerve the foure ends of the two Lines of Latitude and Longitude.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 Becauſe they divide the whole earth into four quarters.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 Becauſe they divide the heavens into four quarters.</p>
                        <p>And in this reſpect the four quarters of the Earth are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:44298:112"/>
called the four wings, or the four corners of the Earth, <hi>Revel.</hi> 7. 1. <hi>Numb.</hi> 24. 17. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11. 12. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 7. 2. <hi>Job</hi> 37. 3. and 38. 13.</p>
                        <p>2 The Heavens are divided into four quarters, and in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the four Winds are ſaid to come from the four quarters of Heaven, <hi>Jer.</hi> 49. 36. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. 9. <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 2. and 8. 2. <hi>Zach.</hi> 2. 6. <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 31.</p>
                        <p>And when the Lines of Latitude and Longitude are drawn upon a Compaſs Dyal or upon a Globe, then they make the four winds in the four quarters of Heaven to lie thus, and to be called thus, North-Eaſt, South-Eaſt, South-weſt, North-weſt.</p>
                        <p>And thus the Holy Scripture doth force us to obſerve the various uſe of theſe two Lines of Longitude and Latitude; and therefore doubtleſs <hi>Job</hi> was not ignorant, but ſpake as a man of knowledge, when he ſaid that God ſtretched out the North up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Empty. Firſt, He was not ignorant of the North point. Nor ſecondly, How far it ſtretched. Nor thirdly, of the time of the Globes emptineſs.</p>
                        <p>3 <hi>Ezekiel</hi> doth direct us to take notice of the North point as the firſt in order of the four Cardinal points, becauſe he doth firſt begin the diviſion of the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> from the North quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſo he ends it with the Weſt quarter, read <hi>Ezek.</hi> 47. from ver. 15. to the end of the Chapter; and in this order alſo the Lord was pleaſed to let <hi>Moſes</hi> take a view of the land, he ſtood in the Land of <hi>Gilead,</hi> and from thence in the firſt place he viewed <hi>Dan</hi> which was the furtheſt Northward and Northally in <hi>Galilee,</hi> which lay alſo Northward. Secondly, Then he viewed the land of <hi>Ephraim</hi> and half <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> which lay Eaſtward from him in the middle of the Land. Thirdly, Then he viewed the Land of <hi>Judah</hi> to the South. And fourthly, Then he viewed the Land of <hi>Jerico</hi> which lay in the Weſt of <hi>Canaan.</hi> See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Deut.</hi> 34. 1, 2, 3.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, I will indeavor to prove that the Morning began with the firſt darkneſs, and that the firſt darkneſs muſt be placed at the North point by another phraſe of <hi>Job,</hi> for <hi>Job</hi> doth tell us that when the winds have purged the Air, and made it clear from clouds and vapours, that then out of the North a golden light doth ſhew it ſelf, <hi>Job</hi> 37. 22. Our eie-ſight may witneſs the truth of this point, for in a clear Morning before Sun-riſing we may often ſee a golden liſt of light ſtretching it ſelf from the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:44298:112"/>
North point to the Eaſt; and again after Sun-ſet we may often ſee a golden liſt of light ſtretching it ſelf from the Weſt point to the North point. This Obſervation, Firſt, Of the golden liſt from North to Eaſt, may teach us that the root of the Morning comes from the North point, where the Mid-night begins by the Compaſs-Dyall. And Secondly, The gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den liſt in the Evening after Sun-ſet from Weſt to North, may teach us that the Evening doth reach unto Mid-night, or to the North point.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, I prove that the Natural Morning doth begin at Mid-night, becauſe the morning of the fifteenth day of <hi>Niſhan</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan at Mid-night.</p>
                        <p>I collect it thus, <hi>Moſes</hi> at the firſt paſſeover in <hi>Egypt</hi> gave a very ſtrict charge to all the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> that no man ſhould go out of the door of his houſe untill the Morning, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 22. name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not untill the morning of the fifteenth day was come; this was <hi>Moſes</hi> expreſs charge. Hence I reaſon thus, if any man of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> had gone out of the door of his houſe before the morning of the fifteenth day was truely come, contrary to this charge (as thoſe did that went out of the door of their houſes to gather Manna on the Sabbath-day morning) they would have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned as Tranſgreſſors for it (as they were that gathered Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na on the Sabbath day morning, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. 27. 28.)</p>
                        <p>But all the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> went out of the doors of their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes either at Mid-night or preſently after, as it appears by ver. 33. and 39. and yet none of them were condemned as tranſgreſſors for it: But on the contrary, their exact obedience to all <hi>Moſes</hi> commands is twice over teſtified in ver. 28. and twice over again in ver. 50. The Text ſaith, they did all things as God comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> ſo did they, Even as exactly as <hi>Noah</hi> did in making the Arke, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 22. or as <hi>Moſes</hi> did in making the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, <hi>Exod.</hi> 40. 16. for their obedience is alike ſet out by the ſame double expreſſion.</p>
                        <p>Therefore ſeeing all the people were thus exact in their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to all <hi>Moſes</hi> commands; it follows, that they did not go out of the doors of their houſes untill the morning of the fifteenth day was come, and yet they went out of the doors of their houſes at Mid-night, or preſently after, becauſe they knew that the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the fifteenth day was begun at Mid-night.</p>
                        <p>

Yea, It is evident that <hi>Moſes</hi> intended they ſhould all go out of their doors in the Morning preſently after Mid-night, becauſe he had foretold them, that all the firſt-born of <hi>Egypt</hi> ſhould be ſlain at Mid-night, <hi>Exod.</hi> 11. 4. 5. And ſecondly, He had foretold them that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> would thruſt them out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> v. 1. and that the Nobles would come and bow down to <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaying, <hi>Go thou out and all the people at thy feet, Exod.</hi> 11. 8. Yea, <hi>Moſes</hi> did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them for a ſudden departing from their houſes, becauſe he commanded to eat the Paſſeover with their loyns girded, with their ſhooes on their feet, and with their ſtaves in their hands, and to eat it in haſte, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 11. all theſe things do teſtifie that <hi>Moſes</hi> intended they ſhould go out of the doors of their houſes as ſoon as ever the morning of the fifteenth day was come, and he meant it was come as ſoon as Midnight was come.</p>
                        <p>Object. 5. <hi>I grant that all</hi> Iſrael <hi>departed out of</hi> Egypt <hi>on the fifteenth day of</hi> Niſhan, Numb. 33. 3. <hi>But how prove you that they began their journey at Midnight, or that the fifteenth day began at Mid-night?</hi>

                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> The circumſtances of the Text do prove it plain enough; for as ſoon as the <hi>Egyptians</hi> ſaw all their firſt-born ſlain at Mid-night, they feared leſt they ſhould be all ſlain, and therefore they did urge the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in all haſte to depart, and the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> knew all this before-hand, and accordingly they prepared for their ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy departure, and becauſe of this their preparation they are ſaid to depart out of <hi>Egypt</hi> in the night, <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 1. compared with <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 29. 31, 42. The <hi>Egyptians</hi> therefore as ſoon as their firſt-born were ſlain at Midnight, urged the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in haſte to depart, and then alſo the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did depart out of the doors of their houſes, becauſe the morning of the fifteenth day was come, but yet they could not fully depart out of <hi>Egypt</hi> untill the body of the ſelf ſame day was come, namely, not till it was Mid-day. See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 41. they had many buſineſſes to do after they went out of the doors of their houſes before they could ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly depart; for they muſt aſſemble together 600000 men beſides wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and children, and many connexed people and cattle, and before all this could be put into a fit poſture for their orderly marching away, it was Mid-day, and yet they made extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry haſte to bring things thus ſoon to paſſe, and through their great haſte they took their Dough as it was unleavened, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried it upon their ſhoulders, ver. 34. and thenceforth the fifteenth

                        <p>Their Journey in the night began in this order, as ſoon as the firſt-born of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and the Nobles were ſlain at Mid-night, then in their perplexed fear they did haſtily call up <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> to depart, and then they gave the Alarm to the reſt, and as the firſt of them marched through the land of <hi>Goſhen,</hi> the reſt fell in by Troops, but before they could be all marſhalled to depart in fit order, it was Mid-day, and in this ſort their march began at Mid-night, and was compleated by Mid-day, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Numb.</hi> 33. 3.</p>

                           <hi>Proving, That the Jewes Cuſtom in beginning their weekly Sabbath at the Sun-ſet Evening, was occaſioned by their Ceremonial Cuſtom, namely, Becauſe the perſons that were ceremonially purified from their ceremonial Defilements, were commanded to begin their new day of cleanneſs then; and hence it follows, firſt, That that accidental beginning of the Day muſt not be accounted for the true beginning of the Natural Day; And Secondly, Hence it follows, That it is not the right time for us Chriſtians to begin our Lords Day at the Sun-ſet Evening, as the Jews did by their ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial Cuſtom onely.</hi>

                        <p>THe Jews were often guilty of ſundry degrees of ſins of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs againſt the Ceremonial Law (beſides their ſins a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Moral Law) as you may find them noted and diſtinguiſhed by Mr. <hi>Ainſworth</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 11. 24, 25, 32. and in <hi>Lev.</hi> 12. 6. and in <hi>Lev.</hi> 22. 7. compared with <hi>Numb.</hi> 9. 10. and with <hi>Lev.</hi> 13. 6. and ſee alſo <hi>Lev.</hi> 14. 9, 17. and <hi>Num.</hi> 5. 2, 3. and <hi>Numb.</hi> 19. 2, 7, 11.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, Anſwerable thereunto, the Ceremonial Law did ordain ſeveral degrees of purification, from theſe ſeveral degrees of cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial uncleanneſs; as you may find them noted alſo by <hi>Ainſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth,</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 5. 2. <hi>Lev.</hi> 14. 9, 15. <hi>Lev.</hi> 15. 14. <hi>Num.</hi> 5. 7. <hi>Num.</hi> 19. 18. <hi>Gen.</hi> 35. 2. and in <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, Not onely the manner how, but alſo the time when they muſt cleanſe themſelves, was ordained and appointed by the Ceremonial Law.</p>
                        <p>Some kind of defilements might be clenſed in one day, but the greateſt degrees of their Ceremonial defilements required not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one, but many dayes for their cleanſing; but all were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to begin their cleanſing in the Evening in two degrees of time, according to the two parts of the Evening, for the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:44298:114"/>
Evening hath two equal parts (as I have ſhewed in Chap. 2. and ſhall further ſhew it in the next. Chapter.)</p>
                        <p>In the firſt Evening (which doth always begin at Mid-day) they muſt baptize or waſh themſelves. <note place="margin">The Jews were cleanſed from their ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, 1. By waſhing in the afternoon; And 2. By the Suns ſetting upon them after their bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>In the ſecond Evening (which doth alwaies begin at Sun-ſet) they did begin to date the day of their cleanneſs.</p>
                        <p>For by the ſetting of the Sun upon them, after their waſhing, two things were effected; Firſt, Their cleanneſs by their former waſhing was confirmed or made perfect; And ſecondly, As ſoon as their cleanneſs was made perfect, they began the day of their cleanneſs.</p>
                        <p>Object. 1. <hi>Might not the unclean perſon baptize himſelf from his Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial defilements in the latter evening after Sun-ſet, as well as in the time of the firſt Evening before Sun-ſet?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſ.</hi> He might not, becauſe God had appointed the time of the two Evenings for two diſtinct degrees of their cleanſing<hi>:</hi> The firſt Evening from Mid-day to Sun-ſet was allotted to them for the waſhing or baptizing themſelves from their ceremonial ſins, and this was onely as a preparation to the day of their cleanneſs, And this I will labor to make evident ſeveral waies.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>Moſes</hi> in <hi>Deut.</hi> 23. 11. doth command the unclean perſon to bath himſelf in water, <hi>at the looking forth of the Evening,</hi> So the Hebrew phraſe is, but it may be demanded, what time is that, that is meant by the looking forth of the Evening?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> I have ſhewed you in chap. 2. and in chap. 5. that the Evening doth firſt begin at the firſt declining of the Sun at Mid-day, and that it looks forth towards his ſetting in the weſt from the very firſt declining of the Sun from Mid-day untill it depart from that Horizon, and to this ſenſe I have expounded the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of the Evening to look forth, in <hi>Jer.</hi> 6, 4. See Chap. 2.</p>
                        <p>In like ſort it is ſaid of <hi>Iſaack,</hi> that he went out into the fields to meditate <hi>at the looking forth of the Evening,</hi> Gen. 24. 63. In thoſe daies they had no private upper Rooms to meditate in, becauſe they lived in Tents, and therefore they uſed to ſequeſter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by going out into the fields to meditate, where they had Groves of Trees for ſhade and refreſhing, and thither the godly uſed to go to meditate or to ſtudy divine myſteries in the heat of the day, at the firſt looking forth of the Evening. See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Pſa.</hi> 55. 18.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="52" facs="tcp:44298:115"/>
In like ſort, they uſed to bathe or baptize themſelves from their Ceremonial defilements at the looking forth of the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and then alſo the water was well warmed by the Sun, and ſo made the more fit for bathing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I grant alſo, that it was lawfull for them to bathe themſelves from their Ceremonial defilements all the time that the Sun looked forth by his ſhadowes towards the Weſt, till it was ready to depart out of that Horizon. But this is to be marked, that none were commanded to baptize them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in any part of the morning (onely the Prieſts were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to waſh their hands and their feet every morning, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they were clean before. See <hi>Ainſ. in Exod.</hi> 30. 19, 20.) nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were they commanded to baptize themſelves after Sun-ſet, for except they were baptized before Sun-ſet, they could not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin the day of their cleanneſſe at Sun-ſet, according to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 It is evident, that the appointed ſeaſon for baptizing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from all their Ceremonial defilements was in the time of the firſt Evening, by the Example of <hi>Bathſhebaes</hi> baptizing her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                        <p>The Text ſaith, it was in the Evening when <hi>David aroſe from his bed and walked upon the Roof of the Kings houſe,</hi> then <hi>he ſaw a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man waſhing her ſelf, and the woman was very beautiful to look upon,</hi> 2 Sam. 11<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. This Evening when <hi>David</hi> aroſe from his bed, cannot be underſtood of the latter Sun-ſet Evening, for then for want of Sun-light he could not have diſcerned her beauty from the Roof of his houſe, but it muſt be underſtood of the afternoon Evening; for in thoſe hot Countries they uſed to ſleep in the afternoon up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome Bed or Pallat, as <hi>Iſhboſheth</hi> did, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4. 5. from whence he aroſe and walked upon the flat Roof of his houſe, and thence he beheld the beauty of <hi>Bathſheba</hi> as ſhe was baptizing her ſelf; hence it may be gathered, that the unclean perſons did uſe to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize themſelves from their Ceremonial defilements in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon Evening.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 It is alſo evident, that they baptized themſelves in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon Evening from their Ceremonial defilements by a famous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in <hi>Joſh.</hi> 7. for when the Lords wrath was gone out againſt them, in that the men of <hi>Ai</hi> ſlew about thirty ſix of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that <hi>Achan</hi> had ſtoln the excommunicate thing; then ſaid the Lord to <hi>Joſhua</hi> at the Even-tide, <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>p, and ſanctifie the people, and</hi>
                           <pb n="53" facs="tcp:44298:115"/>
                           <hi>ſay, Sanctifie your ſelves againſt to morrow,</hi> Joſh. 7. 6, 13, 14, 15. and how elſe muſt they ſanctifie themſelves for the Lords preſence at his Ark on the morrow, but by waſhing themſelves from their Ceremonial defilements, for there were ſcarſe any but they were defiled by one accident or other, and none might come before the Lords Ark in their Ceremonial defilements upon pain of being cut off; and before <hi>Joſhua</hi> could make proclamation through the Camp for their purification, and for their ſolemn meeting to ſeek the Lord for mercy on the morrow, it would require a good ſpace of time, therefore this Evening cannot be underſtood of the Sun-ſet Evening, but of the noon-tide Evening, as I have explai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the matter more at large in Chap. 2.</p>
                        <p n="4">4 All <hi>Iſrael</hi> were warned when ever they came before the Lords preſence in his Tabernacle, to be cleanſed from their Ceremonial defilements, eſpecially at their three ſolemn feaſts; but they were not tyed to the obſervation of their Ceremonial baptizing when they reſorted to their Synagogues on their weekly Sabbath daies, for in thoſe places both the clean and the unclean might meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in Gods worſhip, as I have opened the matter in my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of the Jews Synagogues Diſcipline.</p>
                        <p>But under pain of the Lords diſpleaſure none might approach to the Lords Sanctuary without their legal purifications, as it is manifeſt by the example of Gods diſpleaſure againſt ſome of <hi>Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im</hi> &amp; <hi>Manaſſes</hi> when they came to the Paſſeover in the daies of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah</hi> without their purifications; but as ſoon as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved their error (which doubtleſs the conſciences of the viſited per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons made them to acknowledge) he prayed to the Lord for them, &amp; the Lord was intreated, and healed the people, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30. 19, 20. and for the better avoiding of this error afterwards, it was obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as a cuſtom among the Jews, to go out of the Country up to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> before the Feaſt of Paſſeover, to purifie themſelves, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7. 55. which purification was effected by two degrees of clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: Firſt, By baptizing themſelves in the firſt Evening; And ſecondly, By the Sun-ſetting upon them after their baptizing (as I have formerly proved the matter) for none might approach the Sanctuary until they could declare their purification to the Prieſts that were the Porters, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 23. 19. as <hi>Paul</hi> did, <hi>Act.</hi> 21. 26.</p>
                        <p>And the Lord did ſo much approve of their Ceremonial pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, both by their actual baptizing and by their abſtinence from
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:44298:116"/>
unclean meats, and from all other things elſe that might defile them: That for that very obedience he doth cal the whole Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <note place="margin">All Iſrael are called men of Holineſs in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of their ceremonial purity.</note> 
                           <hi>Men of holineſs, Exod.</hi> 22. 31. for all the Nation in general were very careful to maintain this kind of holineſs. And the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Doctors ſay, that if any man of the common people did but ſay, I am clean to keep the ſin-water, he was to be truſted, for there is no man of <hi>Iſrael</hi> too vild for it, See <hi>Ainſ. in Num.</hi> 19. 9. that is to ſay, no man of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was too vild for it, if he were but Ceremonially clean; and in this ſenſe all <hi>Iſrael</hi> were holy, namely, to the purifying of their fleſh; <hi>for the Law is not of Faith, Gal.</hi> 3. 12. a man might keep the Law to the purifying of his fleſh, though they wanted ſaving-Faith to apply the blood of Chriſt for the cleanſing of their conſciences from the guilt of ſin.</p>
                        <p>And thus much touching the firſt degree of time in which they muſt perform the firſt degree of their Ceremonial clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>

                        <p>I Come now to ſpeak of the ſecond degree of time wherein their Ceremonial cleanneſs was perfected, and that was as ſoon as the Sun was ſet upon them after their Ceremonial baptizing, and from that time alſo they began to date the new day of their cleanneſs.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, I prove that God ordained the Sun-ſet Evening to be the time of perfecting the cleanneſs of the baptized perſon, ere he <note place="margin">None were complea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>ly purified by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing baptized til the Sun was ſet upon them.</note> could begin the day of his cleanneſs, by <hi>Deut.</hi> 23. 10, 11. There <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith thus to all <hi>Iſrael, If there be in thee a man that is not clean by reaſon of an accident in the night, then he ſhall go out of the Camp; and he ſhall bath himſelf in water at the looking forth of the Evening</hi> (and what then, was he now made clean as ſoon as ever he had bathed himſelf in water? The anſwer is, no, hee muſt yet ſtay a while longer without the Camp till his Sun be ſet,) <hi>and then when the Sun is gon down he ſhall come into the Camp.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Hence it is evident that his Ceremoniall purity was not compleat until his Sun was ſet, but then it was compleat, and therefore he did then begin to date the day of his cleanneſs.</p>
                        <p>Hence alſo I gather, that their Ceremonial baptizing might be done in any part of the afternoon, provided it were done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:44298:116"/>
Sun-ſet, becauſe the Sun did look forth towards the place of his going down by his ſhadow, from Mid-day, til it went out of that Horizon, as I have formerly explained the matter.</p>
                        <p>But if any were defiled by any accident in the night after his Sun was ſet upon him, he muſt remain in that uncleanneſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till a new baptizing in the next afternoon, and till a new Sun-ſet Evening.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, It is evident, that none were compleatly purified till Sun-ſet, by <hi>Levit.</hi> 22. 5, 6, 7. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith thus, <hi>If any man</hi> (whether Prieſt or Iſraelite) <hi>be made unclean by touching a dead creeping thing,</hi> (or the like unclean thing;) Then (in ver. 6.) <hi>he ſhall be unclean untill the Evening, he ſhall not eat of the holy things.</hi> But firſt, He ſhall bath himſelf in water.

                        </p>
                        <p>By this Text it is alſo evident, that he did not attain to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ceremonial cleanneſs by baptizing himſelf in water, untill the Sun was gon down upon him after his bathing: But as ſoon as his Sun was ſet, then he was compleatly purified, and then alſo he began to date the day of his cleanneſs, and then alſo he might eat of the holy things.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, The Hebrew Doctors do abundantly teſtifie that no baptized perſon did begin the day of his cleanneſs untill his Sun was ſet; for this is their common and peculiar phraſe, <hi>They ſhall be unclean untill their Sun be ſet:</hi> But the common phraſe of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial Law ſaith thus, <hi>They ſhall be unclean untill the Evening. The unclean</hi> (ſaith <hi>Maymony) may not eat of the Heave-Offering untill their Sun be ſet.</hi> See <hi>Ainſ. in Lev.</hi> 22. 9, 10. And hence it is evident, that they held the baptized perſons to have ſome degree of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs upon them, untill their Sun was ſet: And therefore <hi>Maymony</hi> ſaith thus; He that is baptized is the ſecond in unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, untill his Sun be ſet; And he that is ſo baptized (if his Sun bee not ſet) may not eat or drink of the <hi>Trumah</hi> (or holy offerings) nor of any meat or drink that is holy. See <hi>Ainſ. in Lev.</hi> 11. 32. and in <hi>Lev.</hi> 7. 20, 21. and in <hi>Numb.</hi> 19. 19, 20, 21. This phraſe in the Law, <hi>He ſhall be unclean untill the Evening,</hi> is eight times over repeated in <hi>Lev.</hi> 11. and fourteen times over in <hi>Lev.</hi> 15. and often elſewhere: But the Hebrew Doctors do uſually expreſs it, <hi>He ſhall be unclean till his Sun be ſet;</hi> they accounted the term Sun-ſet and the term Evening to be all one time. Hence then it follows,

that the date of their new day of cleanneſs did alwaies begin at the Sun-ſet Evening.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, It is evident, that the Jews began the date of their new day of cleanneſs at the Sun-ſet Evening; becauſe the Sun-ſet <note place="margin">The Jews mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row began at Sun-ſet in Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects.</note> Evening is called <hi>[Their morning]</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30. 17. <hi>David</hi> and his men are ſaid to purſue after the <hi>Amalekites, From the twilight unto the Evening of Their Morrow;</hi> that is to ſay, from the Twilight in the Morning until their Morrow, which began at the Sun-ſet Evening; it was a cuſtom that was proper and peculiar unto them, &amp; differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from other Nations, to date the new day of their cleanneſs from the Sun-ſet Evening; and therefore the Hebrew Text doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the word <hi>Their</hi> unto <hi>David</hi> and his men in ſpecial, calling it <hi>their morrow;</hi> Dr. <hi>Willet</hi> doth explain the word <hi>Morrow</hi> to be the next day after <hi>David</hi> &amp; his men were ſet forth to purſue the <hi>Amalekites;</hi> But the text doth not ſay ſo, but that <hi>David and his men fell upon the Amalekites and purſued their victory, from the Twilight</hi> (in the morning) <hi>untill the Evening of their morrow,</hi> that is, till the Sun-ſet Evening, for at that Evening began their Morrow, or their new day to the perſon purified.</p>
                        <p>2. It is evident that the Sun-ſet Evening was the Jews morrow, from the time of their reckoning of the ſeven weeks to the day of Penticoſt.</p>
                        <p>They are commanded to begin that reckoning <hi>from the morrow of the Sabbath;</hi> meaning by the Sabbath, the firſt day of the feaſt of unleavened bread, which God commanded them to obſerve as a Sabbath, <hi>Lev.</hi> 23. 15. And by the <hi>Morrow</hi> of the Sabbath, is meant the ſecond day of the Feaſt of unleavened bread, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan at the Sun-ſet Evening, at the end of the firſt day, that Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is called the Morrow, (but this is obſervable alſo, that the ſeventh day of the Feaſt of unleavened bread did not end at Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet; but the holy feaſt of that day continued in the night time after Sun-ſet) and in this ſenſe the word <hi>Morrow</hi> muſt be underſtood in ver. 11. and 16.</p>
                        <p>The Hebrew Doctors ſay, they begin this reckoning from the beginning of the day (not from the beginning of the Artificial day as moſt are apt to miſtake their meaning, but) from the night of the ſixteenth of <hi>Niſhan.</hi> See <hi>Ainſ. in Lev.</hi> 23. 15. and it is a known thing (as I have explained the matter) that they did account the night to begin at the Sun-ſet Evening according to the date of the perſon purified.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="57" facs="tcp:44298:117"/>
And in this ſenſe the phraſe of <hi>The next day</hi> in <hi>Matth.</hi> 27. 62. muſt be underſtood; then, the next day that followed the prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, muſt be underſtood of the Sun-ſet Evening.</p>
                        <p>3. As <hi>Boker,</hi> the Morning, is put for the beginning of the day, namely, for the beginning of the Natural day, and for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Artificial day; ſo alſo, it is once put for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Jews Ceremonial day, or for the Sun-ſet Evening, in <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 4. as I have opened the matter more at large in Chap. 5.</p>
                        <p>Theſe places do plainly evidence that the Jews had a double Morning, and a double Morrow (as they had a double year) anſwerable to the Natural Day and to their Ceremonial Day.</p>
                        <p>Object. 2. <hi>Though I am willing to grant that all purified perſons did</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">It is diſputed by ſome that the Sun-ſet Evening is not fully come until it be full Twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what paſt, or elſe they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs it cannot be proved that Chriſt lay three daies in his grave.</note> 
                           <hi>begin the date of their new Day at the Sun-ſet Evening, yet learned men do affirm, that the Sun is not ſet as ſoon as the Body of the Sun is gone out of our ſight; They ſay that as long as there doth remain any light in the Skie the Sun is the cauſe of it, and hence they aſſert, That the Sun is not ſet untill the Darkneſs in the Skie is more than the Light in the Skie; they ſay the Sun is not ſet untill it is full Twilight or ſomewhat paſt: and by this expoſition of the Sun-ſet Evening, they ſay it way be proved that Chriſt lay three daies in his Grave, or elſe they confeſſe it cannot be proved.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> If this grand Objection (which is very great in ſome mens eyes) be fully anſwered, then all the Concluſions that are built upon it muſt needs fall to the ground with it.</p>
                        <p>I confeſs I cannot but wonder that any learned men ſhould make the time of Sun-ſet and the time of Twilight to be all one, for if this be true, then all Aſtronomers muſt go to School again to learn better how to ſet the Minutes of the Suns riſing and of the Suns ſetting. But ſee what I ſay further in anſwer to this Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in Chap. 7.</p>
                        <p>And ſuppoſe a man that holds thus, ſhould hire a laborer to work in his Garden from Sun-riſing till Sun-ſet, and ſuppoſe <note place="margin">That the time of Sun-ſet is fully come as ſoon as the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Sun is gon out of ſight, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it be Twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.</note> this Laborer do contract with him to continue at his labor until the preciſe time of Sun-ſet, and accordingly he continues at his labor untill the Body of the Sun is gon out of ſight, and then he leaves off and takes witneſs of it, and preſently goes to his Maſter for wages according to Contract; his Maſter refuſeth to pay him becauſe he did not continue at his labor until the preciſe
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:44298:118"/>
time of Sun-ſet; he tels him, that the Sun is not yet ſet, becauſe the Light in the Sky is more in quantity than the Darkneſs; for ſaith he, the Sun is the cauſe of that light, and therefore it is not yet ſet, and he takes witneſs, and ſo they part in diſcontent; and becauſe they could not agree about the preciſe time of Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, they refer this controverſie to be determined by competent Judges.</p>
                        <p>And firſt let <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhew his Judgement, what he means by the time of Sun-ſet, or by the Suns going down, for he doth ſhew his judgement by a familiar example; He directed the Jews how to find out Mount <hi>Gerezim</hi> on the other ſide <hi>Jordan, It lies</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>behind the way, at the going down of the Sun, Deut.</hi> 11. 30<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In theſe words <hi>Moſes</hi> doth give them a twofold mark of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>
                        <p>1. <hi>It lies behind,</hi> 2. <hi>It lies at the going down of the Sun,</hi> and I have ſhewed you in expounding <hi>Job</hi> 23. 8, 9. that this phraſe <hi>behind</hi> is often put for the Weſt. And in this ſenſe alſo ſee <hi>Ainſ. in Gen.</hi> 14. 15.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith, <hi>It lies at the going down of the Sun;</hi> if you ſay this going down of the Sun is not meant of the place where the body of the Sun goes out of ſight, but of the place of Twilight, then whither might the Jews wander by that mark of direction to ſeek out Mount <hi>Gerezim?</hi> For when the darkneſs in the Skie is ſomewhat more than the light in the Sky, the Jews might wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der into the North or into the South as well as into the Weſt, for the time and place of Twilight is but an uncertain mark to ſteer their courſe by to Mount <hi>Gerezim.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But to place the time of Sun-ſet where the body of the Sun goes out of ſight, is a perſpicuous mark for the Weſt (when the Sun is in the Equinoctial, as it was when this direction was given) and in this reſpect the time of Sun-ſet is often put for the Weſt. See more in Chap. 2. in anſwer to Objection 3. And ſee <hi>Ainſ. in Pſal.</hi> 113. 3. and this direction agrees to the firſt direction, it is Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, or it is due Weſt.</p>
                        <p>On the contrary when <hi>Moſes</hi> directed them to other places that Iay Eaſt, he directed them thither by the Riſing of the Sun, <hi>Numb.</hi> 21. 11. <hi>Numb.</hi> 34. 15. <hi>Deuter.</hi> 4. 41, 47. <hi>Joſh.</hi> 12. 1. <hi>Joſh.</hi> 19. 27, 34.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, Let <hi>Joſhua</hi> alſo ſhew his judgement about the time
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:44298:118"/>
and place of Sun-ſet, and he declares his judgement by another familiar example, for he directed the <hi>Jews</hi> how to finde out the Weſt bounds of <hi>Canaan,</hi> not by the confuſed, and obſcure mark of Twilight; but firſt, by the perſpicuous mark of Sun-ſet; and ſecondly by the hindmoſt Sea, <hi>Joſ.</hi> 1. 4. he makes the hindmoſt Sea, and the going down of the Sun to be marks <hi>Synonima</hi> for the finding out of the Weſt borders of <hi>Canaan;</hi> and he doth alſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain this hindmoſt Sea to be the great Sea at Sun-ſet, <hi>Joſ.</hi> 23. 4. and <hi>Moſes</hi> likewiſe doth call this Sea the Hindmoſt Sea, <hi>Deut.</hi> 11. 24. But the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Chaldee</hi> call it the Weſtern Sea. So then from the premiſes it follows, That ſeeing the places that lye due Weſt, are marked out by the perſpicuous mark of the going down of the Sun, we muſt thereby underſtand that the Sun-ſet Evening doth begin as ſoon as ever the body of the Sun is gone out of ſight; and therefore hence it follows, that thoſe that make the time of Sun-ſet, and the time of Twilight to be all one (for the begining of our Lords day) do build their opinion but on a ſandy founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, The <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text doth often expreſs the time of Sun-ſet by the going in of the Sun, to lodge all night (as it were in its chamber) and it is ſaid to go in as ſoon as ever the body of the Sun is gone out of our Horizon. See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Pſa.</hi> 50. 1. on the contrary, as ſoon as the body of the Sun is riſen upon our Horizon in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it is ſaid <hi>to come forth</hi> as a <hi>Bridegroom out of his chamber,</hi> Pſal. 19. 5.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, Experience will tell you, that the Sun is ſet as ſoon as ever the body of the Sun is gone out of ſight; or elſe if it be not ſet till the darkneſſe in the skie is more than the light in the skie, then there is no Sun-ſet at all in the North of <hi>England</hi> when the daies are at the longeſt, for experience doth teſtifie that the light is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of the skie there, all the night long, except a little in the middle of the night, and yet experience doth witneſſe that the Sun doth truly ſet there every day.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, Let all Aſtronomers ſhew their judgement when the Sun doth ſet, and they with one conſent do teſtifie that the Sun doth ſet as ſoon as ever the body of the Sun is gon out of ſight, for they deſcribe the time of Sun-ſet, and the time of the Suns riſing, by the firſt appearing of the body of the Sun in the morning, and by the body of the Sun going out of ſight in the evening, as all their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manacks do teſtifie.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="60" facs="tcp:44298:119"/>
Sixthly, Let the Evangeliſt <hi>Marke</hi> ſhew his judgement, for he deſcribes the Evening to begin at Sun-ſet, <hi>Mark.</hi> 1. 32. but <hi>Luke</hi> ſpeaking of the ſame action ſaith, It was when the Sun was ſetting, <hi>Luke</hi> 4 40. put this together, and it implies that the time of the beginning of the Sun-ſet Evening is as ſoon as ever the body of the Sun is gone out of ſight.</p>
                        <p>Seventhly, <hi>Joſhua</hi> doth teſtifie that the Evening is come as ſoon as ever the body of the Sun is gone out of ſight, <hi>Joſ.</hi> 10. 26, 27. and <hi>Daniel</hi> ſaith, That <hi>Darius</hi> did labour to deliver him till the going down of the Sun, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6. 14. But the Seventy ſay, till Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; and <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith, <hi>The ſoul that toucheth a dead creeping thing ſhall be unclean untill the Evening,</hi> Lev. 22 6. but ſaith he, in verſ. 7. <hi>He ſhall bathe himſelf in water, and then he ſhall be clean when the Sun is gone down;</hi> from all theſe places it is evident, that the term Sun-ſet, and the term Evening, are terms convertible for the Sun-ſet Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                        <p>Eighthly, It is evident by this reaſon that the latter Evening doth begin as ſoon as ever the body of the Sun is gone out of ſight, becauſe there is no interim between the End of the firſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening, and the Beginning of the latter Evening; and I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in Chap. 2. that the firſt Evening doth end, as ſoon as ever the Sun doth leave off to make any more ſhadows upon the face of the Earth: For the whole time of the firſt Evening is deſcribed by its ſhadows looking forth towards the place of its Reſt, or by the ſtrotching out of its ſhadows upon the face of the Earth, as I have expounded, <hi>Jer.</hi> 6. 4. and therefore it follows by neceſſary conſequence, that the latter Evening muſt begin at that inſtant time. This conſequence is ſo cleer, that none that loves plain truth can deny it.</p>
                        <p>But to prevent raſh zeal, and unadviſed haſte in feaſting upon the holy fleſh, the Hebrew Doctors adviſed to ſtay a little time after Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, <note place="margin">They begin their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Feſtival Suppers after Sun-ſet, as ſoon as three ſtars appeared in the skie.</note> for the Sun muſt go down upon the baptized perſon before his Purification was perfected, and then he began the date of his new day, and then he was made fit to eat of the holy fleſh; yet they adviſed to ſtay a little time after Sun-ſet, namely till three ſtars appeared in the skie. <hi>Mamony</hi> ſaith, <hi>That the unclean may not eat of the Heave-offering untill their Sun be ſet, and three ſtars appear after the Sun is gone down.</hi> See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 22. 9.</p>
                        <p>Thus have I ſhewed how God ordained the time of the two
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:44298:119"/>
Evenings for the effecting of two degrees of cleanneſſe; and now I ſhall in the next Section ſhew, That all the latter Evening from Sun-ſet till Mid-night, was appointed for the time of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious feaſting upon their Paſſeovers, and Peace-offerings; and that this part of the night was a true part of the former natural day.</p>
                     </div>
                     <div n="3" type="section">

                        <p>FRom the date of the new Day to the perſon purified at the Sun-ſet Evening, we may ſee the true Reaſon that did inforce the <hi>Jewes</hi> to begin all their Ceremonial Sabbaths at that time, and of all other dayes by occaſion thereof.</p>
                        <p>But this beginning of the day was no more to be accounted for the beginning of the natural Day, than the beginning of their yeer in <hi>Niſhan</hi> was to be accounted for the firſt month by Creation; for they began their yeer in <hi>Niſhan</hi> upon the occaſion of their famous deliverance out of <hi>Egypt</hi> in that month; but from the Creation the yeer began in <hi>Tizri,</hi> which now is called the Seventh month, and this ſeventh month was afterwards made famous again by <hi>Joſhua's</hi> Conqueſt of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and by his diviſion of the land thereupon to the nine Tribes and a half, in this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth month, <hi>Joſ.</hi> 14. and in remembrance thereof they began all their yeers of Reſt, and all their Jubiles from that month. See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 1, 2. <hi>Lev.</hi> 25. 8, 9, 10. <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. 22. <hi>Deut.</hi> 14. 22. and likewiſe the yeers of all Servants and Leaſes began at this time, <hi>Lev.</hi> 25.</p>
                        <p>And after this manner they obſerved a double date according to the beginning of their double day. <note place="margin">The Jews ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved both the date of their ceremonial day, and the date of their natural day for ſeveral purpoſes. See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in Lev. 23<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 20.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>1 The perſon purified began the date of his day of cleanneſſe from the Sun-ſet Evening.</p>
                        <p>2 They dated the time of their Religious feaſting according to the natural day till midnight after; for by the Law they were expreſly commanded to eat the fleſh of their Peace-offerings in the ſame day, in which it was ſacrificed, <hi>Lev.</hi> 7. 15. now it was not poſſible for them (at ſometimes at leaſt) to eat the holy fleſh of their Paſſeovers, and of their commanded Peace-offerings, in the ſame Ceremonial day, becauſe the time of ſacrificing their Paſſeovers and Peace-offerings did many times continue until it
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:44298:120"/>
was night, namely till Sun-ſet; and ſo it fell out in the time of <hi>Joſias</hi> Paſſeover, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 35. 14. Hence it follows by a neceſſary conſequence, That the command to eat the holy fleſh in the ſame day muſt be underſtood (not of the ſame Ceremonial, but) of the ſame natural day; and in caſe any of the holy fleſh had remained uneaten in the ſame day in which it was ſacrificed, it muſt be burnt, and then ſometime it muſt be all burnt, and none of it eaten, namely when it was ſacrificed at the point of Sun-ſet.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, If the date of their Ceremonial day had born all the ſway, then they muſt not only have finiſhed the killing of all their Sacrifices, but of all their Religious feaſts alſo, before Sun-ſet, and then our Saviour and his Apoſtles had ſinned, becauſe they kept their Religious Feaſt after Sun-ſet, namely in the night wherein he was betrayed; for though they cauſed their Paſſeover to be ſacrificed on the fourteenth day, yet they deferred the time of their feaſting till after Sun-ſet when the fifteenth day was begun, according to the date of the perſon purified. But if you will grant that our Saviour did not ſin againſt that Command of eating their Paſſeover in the ſame day, then you muſt alſo grant that the ſame fourteenth day by Creation was not ended at Sun-ſet, but continued ſtill till Mid-night after.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, Hence it follows, that ſeeing all Ceremonial Cuſtomes are now aboliſhed by the death of Chriſt; that Gods people ought not to Judaize, in beginning the Lords day according to the Jews Ceremonial Cuſtomes, but according to the beginning and ending of the natural day from midnight to Mid-night.</p>
                        <p>Objection 3. <hi>How could the</hi> Jewes <hi>obſerve a double date of a double day in one and the ſame naturall day without confuſion?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> Their double date of their double day was not ſtrange to them, no more than their double date of their double yeer was to them; they could ſort out ſuch things, as belonged to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the yeer from the ſeventh month from the things that belonged to the beginning of the yeer in the firſt month, without any confuſion at all; ſo in like manner they could ſort out all thoſe Religious duties that belonged to their Ceremonial date, from thoſe duties that belonged to the date of the naturall day.
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:44298:120"/>
They knew that the Baptiſed perſon muſt begin his new day at Sun-ſet, and that all Evening Sacrifices muſt be finiſhed before Sun-ſet; and yet in reſpect of the time of Feaſting, they knew that the ſame Natural day did ſtill continue till mid-night; <hi>May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> ſaith, That the Prieſts muſt eat the Peace-offerings of the Congregation in the ſame Day, and in half the Night. See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 23. 20. Hence you may ſee, that the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors, whom <hi>Maymony</hi> follows, did hold that the ſame day (in the caſe of Feaſting) did continue till mid-night; and indeed this time was ſufficient for the accompliſhment of all their religious Feaſts; in like ſort <hi>Solomon</hi> cals the Twilight evening of the night, the ſame day wherein the Sacrifice was ſlain, <hi>Prov.</hi> 7. 9. but it was not the ſame Ceremonial day, for at Sun-ſet the <hi>Jews</hi> began their next day, or their morrow; but for a fuller anſwer, ſee my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer in Ch. 5. to <hi>Obj.</hi> 8. &amp; 14. &amp; 17.</p>

                     <p>Firſt, All the Paſſeovers, and all the Peace-offerings that were annexed thereunto, were all ſacrificed in the time of the firſt Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and it was utterly unlawful to ſacrifice any Paſſeover, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before this evening began, or after this evening was ended, which did ever begin at Mid-day, and end at Sun-ſet.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Solomon Jarchi</hi> expounds the two evenings thus; From the ſixth hour (which is at Mid-day) and forwards, it is called between the two Evenings, for that the Sun declineth towards his going down, &amp;c. between the evening of the day, and the evening of the night; the evening of the Day is from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the ſeventh hour, and the evening of the Night is when the night begins. See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Numb.</hi> 9. 3.</p>
                     <p>2 <hi>Maymony</hi> ſaith thus; The killing of the Paſſeover is after Mid-day, and if they kill it before it is not allowable; and they kill it not but after the daily evening Sacrifice, and burning of Incenſe, and after they have trimmed the Lamps, then they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to kill the Paſchal Lamb, until the end of the day. See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 6.</p>
                     <p>Till the end of the day was, till the Sun-ſet evening, for after Sun-ſet (ſaith <hi>Maymony)</hi> the blood of all Sacrifices became un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull. See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 1. 9. <hi>Lev.</hi> 6. 9. <hi>Lev.</hi> 7. 18.</p>
                     <p>Hence we ſee that the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors held it as a Canon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, that no Paſſeover was allowable, if it were killed either before Mid-day, or after Sun-ſet; but all the time between was Gods appointed ſeaſon, <hi>Num.</hi> 9. 2. <hi>Lev.</hi> 23. 4.</p>
                     <p>Ordinarily they began to kill their Paſſeovers at half an hour after two a Clock, but if the Paſſeover day fell out to be the <note n="*" place="margin">Some think of no other E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Jews</hi> Sabbath, but the evening be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath; but they are groſly mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken, for that was no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Sabbath but in relation to the new day to the purified perſon, but the evening of the Sabbath it ſelf began and ended as the Paſſeover evening did from mid-day to mid-night.</note> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening of the Sabbath (namely, that evening of the Sabbath which began at Mid-day) then they began to kill their Paſſeover ſooner; But (ſtill this muſt be remembred which <hi>Maymony</hi> often noteth, that) they never kild any Paſſeover till after the daily eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Sacrifice, and ſome other ſervices that did ever accompany it. See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Numb.</hi> 28. 4.</p>

                        <pb n="65" facs="tcp:44298:121"/>
But (ſay the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors) God ſetteth no particular hour, neither for the killing of the daily evening Sacrifice, nor yet for the killing of the Paſſeover; but in general, he commanded them to be killed between the two evenings.</p>
                     <p>Hence it follows, That if they killed the daily evening Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, or the Paſſeover, or the Peace-offerings, in any part of the after-noon, between the time of Mid-day and the Sun-ſet eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, they were allowable, and according to Gods own limited time.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe God requires that all his Worſhip in all the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of it ſhould be done decently, and in order, both in regard of time, place, and perſons; therefore the chief Rulers of the people, thought it their duty to ſuit all the particular bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſes about the Paſſeover, and the daily evening Sacrifice, to certain particular hours in the evening, ſo as all things might be done with the beſt conveniency, decency, and order, that one duty might not ſhoulder out another.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors in the <hi>Babylonian Thalmud</hi> ſay thus; the daily evening Sacrifice was killed at the eighth hour and a half, and it was offered at the ninth hour and a half (that is to ſay, at half an hour after three a Clock) But in the evening of the Paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over it was killed at the ſeventh hour and a half, and offered at the eighth hour and a half (that is to ſay, at half an hour after two a Clock) But if the evening of the Paſſeover did fall out to be upon the evening of the Sabbath, then it was killed at the ſixth hour and a half (that is to ſay, at half an hour after twelve a Clock) and it was offered at ſeven and a half. See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 6.</p>

fell upon a Sabbath, then they began to kill it at half an hour after twelve a Clock, and that was as ſoon as ever they could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the ſhadow of the evening to be ſtretched out, or declined; and the only reaſon why they began thus early upon the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath evening, was, becauſe they might have ſufficient time to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh all the duties of the Sabbath, and all their Paſſeovers, before Sun-ſet, for after Sun-ſet the blood of all Sacrifices became un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, becauſe God had expreſly commanded all evening Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices to be killed between the two Evenings, and becauſe they had much work to do on Paſſeover evenings, eſpecially when it fell on the Sabbath, they muſt begin to kill the daily evening Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice at the firſt declining of the Sun, or elſe they could not kill all by Sun-ſet; for in the time of <hi>Joſiahs</hi> Paſſeover, the Paſſeovers, and Peace-offerings were ſo many, that the Prieſts could not finiſh all till night, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 35. 14.</p>
                     <p>Obj. 1. <hi>You have often cited the</hi> Hebrew <hi>Doctors, as if they did all agree in one, That the Natural evening did begin at Mid-day; but Mr.</hi> Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Shepheard <hi>in his third Part on the Sabbath,</hi> Theſis 36. <hi>doth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that the</hi> Hebrew <hi>Doctors teſtimonies are of little worth, becauſe they do often contradict one another about the beginning of the evening, for though ſome of them do ſay, that the evening doth begin at Mid-day, yet they are over whelmed with croſſe teſtimonies, from the moſt of their Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, who begin it ſome about one, ſome about two a Clock in the afternoon; and</hi> Joſephus, <hi>who is one of moſt credit, in his Writings tels us, That they began their firſt evening about three a Clock in the afternoon.</hi>

I grant that ſome of them do ſpeak of the beginning of the Evening at one hour, and ſome at another, and yet all this without any contradiction; for in regard of ſeverall duties that muſt be tranſ-acted at ſeveral hours in the evening, they had juſt occaſion to ſpeak of the beginning of the evening at ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral hours, in relation to the ſaid ſeveral duties that muſt begin at ſeveral hours of the ſaid evening, as I noted it in <hi>chap.</hi> 2. in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to <hi>Obj.</hi> 1. at ſeventhly, and as I have noted it immediately afore from the <hi>Babylonian Thalmud.</hi>

Sun-ſet, ſo that they might have killed all their Paſſeovers pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after Mid-day, or they might have ſtaid till neer Sun-ſet, provided it were done before Sun-ſet; but they could not kill all their Paſſeovers in <hi>Canaan</hi> at an inſtant, at the time of Sun-ſet, as they might have done in <hi>Egypt;</hi> for.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 In <hi>Egypt</hi> every firſt-born of every family might kil the Paſchal Lamb.</p>

                     <p n="3">3 They might ſprinkle the blood of it upon their door-poſts without going to the Altar.</p>
                     <p>But in <hi>Canaan</hi> they muſt have a longer ſpace of time to do theſe works in; for,</p>
                     <p n="1">1 The firſt-born of every family might not kill their Sacrifices in <hi>Canaan,</hi> but in their place the Lord choſe the Tribe of <hi>Levy.</hi> See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. 22. <hi>Num.</hi> 3. 12. 41, 45. <hi>Exod.</hi> 24. 5. and the number of this Tribe, I conceive, were not ſo many as the firſt-born were in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and therefore could not kill all in ſo ſhort a time.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 The Levites had many more buſineſſes to do about the Paſſeover in <hi>Canaan</hi> than in <hi>Egypt</hi> (eſpecially if the Paſſeover fell out upon a Sabbath) for ſaith <hi>Maymony, They kill not the Paſſeover,</hi> but after the daily evening ſacrifice, &amp; after the burning of incenſe, and after they have trimmed the Lamps, and beſides in <hi>Canaan</hi> they uſed to kill many Peace-offerings therewith: all this would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire more time than the firſt-born of every family needed in <hi>Egypt</hi> for the killing of the Paſchal Lamb onely, without theſe other ſervices.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 They might not kill their Paſſeovers in <hi>Canaan</hi> in private houſes as they did in <hi>Egypt;</hi> but all their Paſſeovers muſt be brought to be ſacrificed at the place the Lord ſhould chooſe to place his braſen Altar at, which at firſt was at <hi>Shilo,</hi> and at laſt in <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple.

                     <p>If the <hi>Jewes</hi> had thought it as lawful for them to kill the Paſſeover in a private houſe (ever ſince the deſtruction of the Temple) as they did at the firſt Paſſeover in <hi>Egypt,</hi> then doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they would not have omitted to ſacrifice the Paſſeover now in all the places of their diſperſion; but ever ſince their Temple was deſtroyed, they have been without the Paſſeover, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all other Sacrifices for the ſpace of ſixteen hundred yeers to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; And thus ſpeaketh Mr. <hi>Broughton</hi> from the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors: He that ſhall kill the <hi>Paſcha,</hi> ever ſince Jeſus Chriſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered <hi>Canaan,</hi> in a private houſe, had been held an open enemy to the truth of God.

God was wroth with <hi>Shilo,</hi> and forſook it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. 60. for by that great deſtruction of all the valiant men of <hi>Ephraim, Shilo</hi> was now become too weak a place to guard the holy Tabernacle, and the holy Altar, and therefore it was by the Lords advice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved to <hi>Gibbeon,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 1. 3, 4, 5. which was a Royal City, and a place of great ſtrength, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 10. 2. lying in the Tribe of <hi>Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min,</hi> and it was allotted to the Prieſts, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 21. 17. and the <hi>Gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beonites</hi> the ancient inhabitants were given to the Prieſts to cut wood, and draw water for the houſe of the Lord, <hi>Joſh</hi> 9. 21, 23. 27. and afterwards in <hi>Solomons</hi> dayes they were called <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinims,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 9. 2.</p>
                     <p>And from henceforth this place was called the chief High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place, becauſe the Lords Tabernacle, and the Lords Altar were placed therein, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 3. 4. and in that reſpect <hi>David</hi> took care to provide a competent number of Prieſts to attend it: But afterwards when <hi>David</hi> had recovered the Ark from the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtims, and had brought it into the Tent that he had provided for it in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> He divided the Prieſts into two parts, and he appointed <hi>Aſaph</hi> and his brethren to miniſter before the Lord at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16. 37. and he appointed <hi>Zadoc</hi> and his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren to miniſter at the Lords brazen Altar at his Tabernacle at <hi>Gibbeon,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16. 39.</p>
                     <p>But when <hi>Solomon</hi> had finiſhed his Temple, he cauſed the Prieſts firſt of all to bring the Ark of the Lord into its place pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for it in the Temple, and then he cauſed the Prieſts to bring up the Tabernacle of the Congregation, with all the holy veſſels into the Temple, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8. 4. and after this manner the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed <hi>Ephraim,</hi> and choſe the Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> and Mount <hi>Sion</hi> (of <hi>Benjamin)</hi> which he loved. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. 68.</p>
                     <p>This brazen Altar was made and conſecrated to be the publick Altar for the General Aſſemblies of all the twelve Tribes, <hi>Exod.</hi> 27. 1. <hi>Numb.</hi> 7. 1. and in that reſpect where ever this Altar was placed, there was the chief High place, untill <hi>Solomon</hi> had made another brazen Altar in the place of it, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 4. 1.</p>
                     <p>At this Altar was offered the daily Morning and Evening ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices for all the twelve Tribes, and the Paſſeovers of all the twelve Tribes, and they might not be offered in any of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer private High places: The <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors ſay, They ſacrificed not the Paſſeover in a private High-place (no not in the time
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:44298:125"/>
when private High-places were permitted) and whoſoever offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Paſſeover in a private High-place is beaten; for it is ſaid in <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 5. <hi>Thou mayeſt not ſacrifice the Paſſeover in any of thy gates:</hi> we have been taught, that this is a prohibition to kil it in a private High-place, although it be in the time when private High-places were permitted. See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 5. and ſuch a private Altar as this was at <hi>Bethlem</hi> where <hi>Iſhai</hi> had a yeerly Sacrifice, and Feaſt for all the family, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20. 26. and ſuch a private Altar as this did <hi>Saul</hi> build with ſtone, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. 35. And of theſe Altars it is ſaid, that when <hi>Aſa</hi> and <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi> deſtroyed the Idolatrous High-places, that they did not deſtroy theſe High-places, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 22. 43. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15. 17.</p>
                     <p>Now from all the premiſes it follows, That ſeeing they might not kill their Paſſeovers at ſeveral High-places, nor ſprinkle the blood on ſeveral Altars, but at the general High-place, and at the general Altar onely, That all the Paſſeovers in <hi>Canaan</hi> could not be killed, and their blood ſprinkled in ſo ſhort a time as about the time of Sun-ſet, and therefore that Command in <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 6. at the going down of the Sun, muſt not be underſtood of the Sun-ſet Evening, but it muſt be underſtood of the whole time of the Suns declining from Mid-day till Sun-ſet, juſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the time of the two Evenings in <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 6.</p>
                     <p>2. Let me adde another Reaſon why the going down of the Sun in <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 6. cannot be underſtood of the time of Sun-ſet; namely <note place="margin">The Paſſeover day was no Sabbath, it was but a half holy-day.</note> becauſe the fifteenth day according to the date of the perſon pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, began at Sun-ſet; but no Paſſeover might be ſacrificed after the fifteenth day was come, but all are commanded to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed in the fourteenth day at Even.</p>
                     <p>3. No other part of the fourteenth day was commanded to be kept holy, but the Evening of the fourteenth day<hi>:</hi> The <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemy,</hi> and the <hi>Babylonian Thalmuds</hi> ſay, that men might follow their work and labour all the firſt half of the day; but at Mid-day (ſay they) they muſt leave off, and begin their Reſt. <hi>May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> alſo ſaith, <hi>It is not unlawful to do work in the fourteenth of</hi> Niſhan, <hi>ſave from the midſt of the day, and ſo forwards; But</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever doth work in the Paſſeover Evening after Mid-day, he is to be ſcourged o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> excommunicated, becauſe the Evening of the fourteenth day of</hi> Niſhan, <hi>is not like to the Evening of other Feſtival dayes, becauſe in it is the Sacrifice, and the Feaſt.</hi> See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 23. 5.</p>

                        <pb n="73" facs="tcp:44298:125"/>
From theſe Teſtimonies of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors may be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved theſe four <hi>Thalmudical</hi> Tenents.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 That the fourteenth of <hi>Niſhan</hi> was not a full holy-day (as ſome do unadviſedly affirm) it was no more but a half-holiday, namely the full Evening onely.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 That the <hi>Jews</hi> obſerved two ſorts of Evenings to every Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath; one before the Sabbath for the date of the perſon purified; and another from Mid-day, and ſo forwards; for the Evening of the 14. of <hi>Niſhan</hi> (ſaith <hi>Maymony)</hi> is not like unto the evening of other Feſtival dayes, becauſe in it is the Sacrifice, and the Feaſt; But the Evening of other Feſtival dayes, meaning the Evening be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, had no ſacrifice; but yet the Mid-day Evening of every Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtival Sabbath was as holy as the Paſſeover Evening, and had Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, and feaſting belonging to it.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 That the Evening of the fourteenth day was the time of ſacrificing all their Paſſeovers.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 That from the time of Sun-ſet till Mid-night was the time of Feaſting on the Paſſeover, and that it belonged to the Evening of the fourteenth day.</p>
                     <p>Hence I conclude, that when <hi>Moſes</hi> commanded them to kill all their Paſſeovers in the Evening about the going down of the Sun, <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 6. he did not mean it of the Sun-ſet Evening, but of the Mid-day Evening, for then the Sun doth firſt begin to go down, or decline.</p>
                     <p>Object. 4. <hi>If the buſineſſe about the Paſſeover was ſo reſtrained as you ſay it was,</hi>

                     </list>
                     <p>And this was no impoſſible, but a fecible thing, if all circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of quick diſpatch be rightly weighed.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 There was a competent number of Prieſts &amp; Levites that wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon this ſervice; for though at firſt the number of the Prieſts and Levites in the Wilderneſſe from thirty yeers old to fifty, was but eight thouſand five hundred and eighty, <hi>Num.</hi> 4. 48. yet at length they were ſo multiplied, that in the dayes of <hi>David</hi> they were eight and thirty thouſand men, 1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 23. 3.

                     <p n="2">2 The place where they killed all their Paſſeovers and Peace-offerings was not ſtrait, but conveniently ſpacious; for theſe kind of ſacrifices might be killed in any part of the Court of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, becauſe they were numbred among their lighter holy things. But the moſt holy things, ſuch as the Burnt-offering, Sin-offering and Treſpaſſe-offerings were, theſe muſt be killed neerer to the Altar than the Paſſeovers and Peace-offerings were, namely upon the ground cloſe by the North-ſide of the Altar, <hi>Lev.</hi> 1. 11. <hi>Lev.</hi> 7. 2. But the light holy things, ſuch as the Paſſeover, and Peace-offerings were, them they killed, and received the blood in Bowls, in any part of the Court-yard, ſaith <hi>Manymony.</hi> See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 1. 11.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Though no Levite might ſprinkle the blood of any Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice upon the Altar, yet for the quicker diſpatch of many Sacrifices they might kill and receive the blood in Bowls, and ſo bring it <note place="margin">No <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:44298:126"/>
Paſſeovers and Peace-offerings between Mid-day and Sun-ſet; and there is a cleer example that all this was done in the time and manner aforeſaid in the eighteenth yeer of <hi>Joſias,</hi> and yet there never was the like Paſſeover kept in <hi>Iſrael</hi> (namely not when <hi>Iſrael</hi> was joyned with <hi>Judah,</hi> there was not the like Paſſeover, and yet doubtleſſe, there were as many Paſchal Lambs, but never the like multitude of Peace-offerings that were added to the Paſſeover, and in that reſpect they were called the Paſſeover, as they are in <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 2. 4.) from the dayes of <hi>Samuel</hi> the Prophet unto that day, 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 35. 18.</p>
                     <p>Object. 5. <hi>How could ſo many thouſand Paſſeovers be roſted in one Temple, and how could ſo many thouſand people ſit there in companies to feaſt on their Paſſeovers?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> As for the great buſineſs of Roſting ſo many Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>overs, It was not tyed precizely to the Temple as the ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing was: for though there were many Paſſeovers Roſted in the Temple, as there were in the dayes of <hi>Joſiah,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 35. 13. yet that buſineſs might alſo be tranſmitted to any houſe in the Holy City, as I ſhewed a little before, and as the example of our Saviour, and his Apoſtles doth teſtifie; for our Saviour was at <hi>Bethany,</hi> when he ſent two of his Diſciples to make ready the Paſſeover; 1 By carrying their Lamb to the Temple to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed, and thence to a private houſe in the holy City to be ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted; and as ſoon as the Sun-ſet Evening was come, our Saviour came to the place appointed, and as ſoon as the hour for feaſting was come, our Saviour ſat down with the twelve, and he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in feaſting with the twelve firſt on the Paſſeover, and then 2 on their Peace-offerings, with his prayers and exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <note place="margin">It was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for above twenty perſons to joyn together for one Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over.</note> the full time of the latter Evening from Sun-ſet till Mid-night, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 18, 20. By this example, we ſee that thirteen per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons may conveniently joyn together at one Paſſeover, and the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> Doctors ſay, That twenty may make their account for one Lamb, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 4. but not above twenty.</p>
                     <p>By this means we may perceive that all the Paſsovers in <hi>Canaan</hi> might well be diſpatched in the Evening of the fourteenth day, in the firſt Evening they might be all ſacrificed, and in the ſecond Evening they might all be feaſted on with Religious ſolemnity, without any doubt to the contrary.</p>

                     <p>Now for Anſwer in a more ſpecial manner, the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors do comprehend under the general term of the Feaſt of Unleavened-bread (and more eſpecially under the firſt day of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leavened-bread) the Feaſt of the Paſchal Lamb; for though they are two diſtinct Feaſts, yet they are alſo ſo interwoven together, that they may well be called the one for the other; for though the Paſchal Lamb was alwayes ſacrificed on the 14. day between the two Evenings, yet the time of feaſting on that holy fleſh, was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Sun-ſet, which was after the fifteenth day (called the firſt of Unleavened-bread) was begun, according to the date of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon purified; and yet the Feaſt of this Evening was no part of the Feaſt of Unleavened-bread, for the ſacrifices of that day were not yet killed; but this Feaſt was the proper Feaſt of the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over belonging to the fourteenth day, and with the Paſſeover alſo they might not eat any Leavened (but Unleavened) bread, and in this reſpect <hi>Maymony</hi> doth call the Feaſt of the Paſchal Lamb, the Feaſt of Unleavened-bread, and ſometimes he calls the ſeven days of the proper Feaſt of Unleavened bread by the name of the Paſſeover, interchangeably confounding the termer. See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 23. 7. and in this ſenſe alſo <hi>Targum Jonathan</hi> calls the ſecond day of Unleavened-bread, the day that followed the firſt good day of Paſſeover. See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 23. 15.</p>

Hence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you ſee, that he cals the firſt day of Unleavened-bread, The firſt good day of the Paſſeover, and ſo interchangeably they call the proper feaſt of the <hi>Paſcha,</hi> the firſt day of Unleavened-bread; and from this uſual dialect among them the Evangeliſt <hi>Matthew</hi> ſaith, <hi>That the Diſciples came to Jeſus Chriſt on the firſt day of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleavened bread,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>But yet ſecondly, The <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors do ſometimes diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the proper Feaſt of the <hi>Paſcha</hi> from the firſt day of the proper Feaſt of Unleavened bread; <hi>Charkumi</hi> calleth the Evening of the firſt good day, and that Night, the Paſſeover; But (ſaith he) the reſidue of the Feaſt from the firſt Night, and ſo forwards, is called the Feaſt of Unleavened-cakes; See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 23. 6. and according to this diſtinction ſpeaketh the Evangeliſt <hi>Mark, Mar.</hi> 14. 1. after two dayes followed the <hi>Paſcha,</hi> and the Unleavened-bread; and this diſtinction doth alſo agree with the twofold Command in <hi>Moſes,</hi> In the fourteenth day of the firſt month is the Paſſeover; And in the fifteenth day (which begins at Sun-ſet) is the Feaſt, <hi>Numb.</hi> 28. 16, 17.</p>
                     <p>Object. 9. <hi>Mr.</hi> Weams <hi>and others, do affirm, That the</hi> Jews <hi>ate not the Paſsover on the fourteenth of</hi> Niſhan <hi>as Chriſt did, but transferred it to the fifteenth day, and to the beginning of the ſixteenth day; and he gives this reaſon for it, becauſe the next day (after Chriſt had eaten his Paſsover) is called the Preparation-day to the Jewiſh Paſsover,</hi> Joh. 18. 28. Joh. 19. 14. <hi>Hence he infers, that the</hi> Jews <hi>transferred the eating of the Paſsover till the next day after Chriſt had eaten his.

                     <p>Secondly, The Evangeliſt <hi>Mark</hi> doth teſtifie on the <hi>Jews</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half againſt all men, that they kept the Paſcha in the very ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame day that our Lord and his Diſciples did, for <hi>Mark</hi> doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe it thus; <hi>In the firſt day of unleavened Bread, [when they Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed the Paſſeover] his Diſciples ſaid unto him, Where wilt thou that we go and prepare that thou maiſt eat the Paſſeover?</hi> Mark 14. 12. this term <hi>[when they]</hi> namely when the <hi>Iews</hi> in general ſacrificed the Paſſeover, then his Diſciples ſaid unto him, Where wilt thou that we go and prepare, that thou (as wel as they) maiſt eat the Paſſeover on the ſelf-ſame day as the <hi>Iews</hi> in general did.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Chriſt himſelf doth bear witneſſe, that the <hi>Iews</hi> in general did keep the Paſcha in the very ſelf-ſame day that hee did; <hi>Yee know</hi> (ſaid Chriſt unto his Diſciples) <hi>that after two days the Paſcha is kept,</hi> Mat. 26. 2. he ſaith, You know it, that the Paſcha is then kept; it was a known cuſtom among them, that after two days the Paſcha is kept, namely generally of all the <hi>Iews.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, The Hebrew Doctors do proteſt, that they puniſh him that paſſeth the fourteenth day for the killing of the Paſcha; <hi>Maymony</hi> ſaith, it is an expreſſe Commandment to kill the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha in the month <hi>Niſhan,</hi> in the 14th. day, and (ſaith he) he that breaketh this Commandment and killeth it not in the 14th. day, being not defiled, nor in a far journey, is guilty of being rooted out (or cut off) thus the <hi>Iews</hi> proteſt againſt our ſlander. See <hi>Bro.</hi> in his Advertiſement of corruptions in Religion, <hi>p.</hi> 104.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, This our groſſe miſtake of the <hi>Iews</hi> practiſe doth ariſe from our miſtake of the meaning of the word Paſſeover, in <hi>Iohn</hi> 18. 28. he ſaith thus; <hi>The Iews went not into</hi> Pilates <hi>common Hall teſt they ſhould be defiled, but that they might eat the Paſſeover;</hi> and in ch. 19. 14. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, <hi>It was the preparation of the Paſſeover, and about the ſixth hour.</hi> Hence ſome that are not wel acquainted with the <hi>Iews</hi> cuſtoms, which are now recorded in their <hi>Thalmuds,</hi> as the learned do obſerve, have collected this inference, that the <hi>Iews</hi> tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:44298:129"/>
the Paſſeover from the evening of the fourteenth day, to the evening of the fifteenth day, and alſo to the ſixteenth day; but indeed in this term Paſſeover <hi>Iohn</hi> doth <hi>Thalmudize,</hi> and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore without the help of the Hebrew Doctors it is not eaſie to ſpel <hi>Iohns</hi> meaning; they apply the term Paſſeover not only to the proper Feaſt of the Paſcha, but (as I noted in my anſwer to the former objection) they uſe it as a general term for the whole Feaſt of unleavened Bread, and in that reſpect they count all the days of it as if they were the days of the Paſſeover; but more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially they did account the firſt day of unleavened Bread to be a Paſſeover day, becauſe they did then feaſt on the Peace-offerings belonging to the Paſſeover, for they ſacrificed with the Paſchal Lamb on the fourteenth day, certain Peace-offerings of Sheep or Oxen, and theſe voluntary Peace-offerings they called the Paſſeover, becauſe they were ſacrificed together with the Paſchal Lamb on the fourteenth day; and by the Law they might bee eaten for the ſpace of two days and one night, <hi>Levit.</hi> 7. 16. now the <hi>Iews</hi> had eaten the Paſchal Lamb the night before, but they had not as yet ended their feaſting on theſe Peace-offerings, which <hi>Iohn</hi> calls the Paſſeover; the term Paſſeover in this laſt ſenſe is not underſtood of many; but Mr. <hi>Broughton</hi> and Mr. <hi>Ainſworth</hi> have given ſpecial notice of the word Paſſeover in this ſenſe, and that the Hebrew Doctors had grounded their common uſe of it on the Law, in <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 2. 4. and Mr. <hi>Broughton</hi> cites <hi>Solomon Jar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi</hi> ſpeaking thus in <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. If many belong to one Paſſeover, then they adde to it <hi>Chagiga,</hi> Oxen, for the Holy-day feaſt, and ſaith <hi>Jarchy</hi> (preſently after) the proper ſenſe of the Scripture is, that the fleſh of the Chagigah-Paſſeover, which thou doſt ſacrifice in the evening with the Lamb-Paſſeover, ſhal be eaten in the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth day, and in the fifteenth day (take notice by the way that he makes no mention of the ſixteenth day, as Mr. <hi>Weames</hi> doth moſt falſly.)</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Maymony</hi> alſo ſaith, When they offered the Paſſeover in the firſt Month, they offered it with the Peace-offerings of the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth day, Oxen, or Flock-beaſts, great or ſmall, Male or Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male; but they offered not the <hi>Chagigah</hi> if the Lamb ſufficed the company, and ſo it was voluntary and not forced by (any affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative) Commandment, and it was eaten two days and one night (and not in the ſecond night, as M. <hi>Weames</hi> doth miſtaking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay.)</p>

In theſe words <hi>Maymony</hi> doth tell us, that <hi>Iohn</hi> ſpake from the depth of <hi>Thalmudique</hi> knowledge, and in this ſenſe alſo doth Mr. <hi>Ainſworth</hi> explain the equivocation of the word Paſſeover from the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors, in <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 2, 4. and in <hi>Lev.</hi> 7. 16.</p>

                        <hi>John</hi> ſaith it was morning, and it was the preparation of the Paſſeover, and about the ſixth hour, which ſixth hour, according to their account by their great hours, began at our ten a Clock, and ended with our twelve a Clock, and this time was called the <hi>Jews</hi> preparation in order to their Paſſeover Dinner, and in that reſpect they were afraid to come into <hi>Pilates</hi> Common Hall leſt they ſhould be defiled, and ſo might be made unfit to eat the Paſſeovers Peace-offerings at Dinner time.</p>
                     <p>Object. 10. <hi>You ſay that by the allowance of the Law the</hi> Jews <hi>might feaſt on the Peace-offerings that were offered with the Paſſeover, for two days and one night, namely, till the next day at Sun-ſet, but not after Sun-ſet; but</hi> John <hi>ſpeaks of another preparation to the Sabbath, his words in</hi> chap. 19. 31. <hi>run thus; The</hi> Jews <hi>then becauſe it was the prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the bodies ſhould not remain upon the Croſſe (for that Sabbath was a high day) beſought</hi> Pilate <hi>that their leggs might be broken, and that they might be taken down.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> This preparation is indeed a differing preparation from the former, the former was their fore-noon preparation to their Paſſeover Dinner, but this preparation was nigh unto Sun-ſet, and ſo conſequently it approached apace unto that feſtival Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, that did properly belong unto the Feaſt of unleavened Bread, and in that reſpect they beſought <hi>Pilate</hi> that their leggs might be
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:44298:130"/>
broken, and that they might be taken down, leſt their cruelty, in ſuffering them to hang longer on the Tree, ſhould be a blot to their joyful Feaſt, for this day was the firſt of unleavened Bread, which was the firſt and the chief of all their High Sabbaths: Now as ſoon as the chief Prieſts had made this requeſt to <hi>Pilate, Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea</hi> did wiſely eſpy the advantage of time, and then he alſo went boldly unto <hi>Pilate,</hi> requeſting that he might have the Body of Jeſus in his own power to bury it. The time when this was done was when the Evening was come, as two Evangeliſts do witneſſe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 17. <hi>Mar.</hi> 15. 42. and ſo <hi>Tindall</hi> in his Bible doth tranſlate and expound <hi>Mark</hi> 15. 42. thus, <hi>When night was come,</hi> becauſe it was the evening that goeth before the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath.</p>

and that was a perſpicuous mark of the near time of their Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val Supper, but they did not begin their Feſtival Supper till three Stars appeared, as I have noted in chap. 4. and <hi>Luke</hi> doth relate to this cuſtom of theirs, in ſhewing that the time of Chriſts Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial was, when the Sabbath began to lighten; but I beleeve the chief Prieſts did deferre the time of their feaſting now ſomewhat longer than at other times, becauſe they had ſome buſineſſe to do with <hi>Pilate</hi> before they could intend their Feſtival Supper, for they went to <hi>Pilate</hi> to intreat him, that the Sepulchre might be made ſure until the third day, becauſe this Deceiver ſaid, that he would riſe again the third day, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 62, 63.

                     <p>Their Satanical policy would not ſuffer them to ſtay ſo long as until the next morning, for then <hi>Pilate</hi> would have ſaid to them, Why did you neglect to ſet a Watch about his Sepulcre over night, as ſoon as he was buried, for if his Diſciples had had any minde to ſteale him away they would have done it in the firſt part of the night? and doubtleſſe when the Souldiers came to

the chief Prieſts to tell them what had happened, the chief Prieſts would have ſaid that his Diſciples ſtole him away before they began their watch; but the chief Prieſts could not plead that excuſe becauſe they went preſently to the ſepulchre, and made it ſure, ſealing the ſtone, and ſetting a watch, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27. 66. Hence it follows, that they went to <hi>Pilate</hi> in the beginning of their next Ceremonial day, namely preſently after Sun-ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they began their Feſtival Supper.</p>
                     <p>2 <hi>Pilates</hi> anſwer to their requeſt implies that they came over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, for <hi>Pilate</hi> ſaith, <hi>You have a Watch, go make it ſure as you know.</hi> Hence it follows, that they came to <hi>Pilate</hi> when Watches were wont to be ſet; but if they had not come to him til the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, then in reaſon he would have ſaid, <hi>Get Warders, and make it ſure.</hi> Hence it follows, that the next day in which they came to <hi>Pilate</hi> was at the Sun-ſet Evening, for that was their next day, or it was their morrow, as I have opened, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30. 17. and <hi>Lev.</hi> 27. 15. All theſe conſiderations laid together make it evident that the time ere Chriſt was incloſed in the heart of the earth, was when the Sabbath began to lighten with ſtars.</p>
                     <p>Object. 13. <hi>How can you call their Feſtival Supper the proper Feaſt that doth moſt properly belong to the first day of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleavened-bread; had they not a Feſtival Dinner belonging to this High Sabbath as well as a Feſtival Supper?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> I grant they had a Feſtival Dinner belonging to this day, as well as a Feſtival Supper; but my meaning is, that their Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtival Dinner was not intirely made of the ſacrifices of this day, as their Feſtival Supper was: for part of their Feſtival Dinner (at leaſt) was made of the Remainder of thoſe Peace-offerings which were ſacrificed in the former day with the Lamb-Paſſeover, and ſo by that means their feſtival Dinner did partake of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices of the fourteenth day; but their Feſtival Supper was made intirely of the Sacrifices of the fifteenth day, and yet this Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-Feaſt was kept in the night after the date of the Ceremonial beginning of the ſixteenth day, in which none of the fleſh of their Chagigah-Paſſeover might remain, for that had been to keep the holy fleſh within the third day, which was plainly prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the letter of the Law: Hence it followes, that all the fleſh of their Chagigah-Paſſeover muſt be eaten at Dinner, or elſe if any of it did remain untill the beginning of the ſixteenth day it muſt
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:44298:132"/>
be burnt, <hi>Lev.</hi> 7. 17. and therefore it follows that this high Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-Supper was intirely made of the Sacrifices of the fifteenth day, and in that reſpect, it was the moſt proper ſolemn Feaſt of this High Sabbath.</p>
                     <p>Object 14. <hi>It ſeems to me that</hi> Moſes <hi>doth allow the fleſh of the Chagigah-Paſſeover to remain unto the morning of the third day, in</hi> Deu. 16. 4. <hi>and that is a longer time than you ſpeak of from</hi> Lev. 7. 17.</p>

I have given ſeveral inſtances) and accordingly in this place it is figuratively put for the beginning of the Ceremonial day at Sun-ſet; for <hi>Moſes</hi> in <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 4. might not give a contrary Law to what he had before given in <hi>Lev.</hi> 7. 17. There he doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſay, that none of the fleſh of the voluntary Peace-offerings ſhall remain untill the third day, if any thing thereof remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the third day it ſhall be burnt. Hence it follows by neceſſary conſequence, that <hi>Boker,</hi> the morning, in <hi>Deu.</hi> 16. 4. muſt be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in a figurative ſenſe for the beginning of their Ceremonial day at Sun-ſet, and therfore none of the fleſh of the Chagigah-Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, <hi>(Moſes</hi> doth not ſpeak of the Lamb-Paſſeover in <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 2. but of the Cagigah-Paſſeover) of Sheep and Oxen, which were ſacrificed in the fourteenth day with the Paſchal Lamb, none of this fleſh might remain untill the beginning, or untill the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſixteenth day at Sun-ſet, for then the fleſh would have remained untill the third day after it was ſacrificed, and then might not be eaten, but it muſt be burnt.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors teſtifie, that the fleſh of their vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Peace-offerings muſt remain but one whole night after it was ſacrificed, and ſo conſequently but one natural morning. <hi>Maymony</hi> ſaith thus, By word of mouth we have learned that this is a prohibition for leaving the fleſh of the <hi>Cagigah</hi> of the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth day unto the ſixteenth day, as it ſaid <hi>[unto the morning]</hi> that is till the morning of the ſecond day. See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Deu.</hi> 16. 4. their meanings, that it ſhould not be kept untill the beginning
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:44298:132"/>
(or untill the morning) of the ſixteenth day, which begins at Sun-ſet; in theſe words <hi>Moſes</hi> doth truly, though figuratively, call the Sun-ſet Evening, the morning, in <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 4. This is a myſtery that belongs peculiarly to the Ceremonial Law, which the inexpert cannot preſently perceive; the like myſtery it is to call the beginning of the Jews Ceremonial day, the morrow, as it is three times over called in <hi>Lev.</hi> 23. 11, 15, 16. and once more in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30. 17. as it is explained in Chap. 4. and it is called their next day in <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 62.</p>
                     <p>And it is a further myſtery alſo that the Jews Ceremonial day ſhould begin ſix hours before the Natural day is ended. As for example, The fifteenth day of <hi>Niſhan</hi> was the firſt day of Unlea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened bread, and a high Sabbath, and by their Ceremonial cuſtome it began before the Evening of the fourteenth day was ended; for the Paſſeover of the fourteenth day was not feaſted on till after Sun-ſet, namely, not till after the fifteenth day by their Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial account was begun, according to the date of the perſon pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified. Theſe are Riddles to ſuch as are not ſtudious in the <hi>Jews</hi> cuſtomes: They could not keep their Religious Feſtival Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers in the ſame Ceremonial day, for then they muſt have kept them the night before their Sacrifices were offered, which was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible; therefore the night after their Feſtival Sabbaths, was the proper night of the Sabbaths by Creation, though not by Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony; for the Ceremonial day, in which the polluted perſon muſt be purified againſt their feſtival Sabbaths, muſt needs begin the date of their new day before hand; and yet they muſt alſo keep the Feſtival Supper appertaining to the Sabbath in the night after, and ſo by this means, the Ceremonial day was interwoven with the Natural day for the ſeveral reſpects already named, and therefore this phraſe, It ſhall be eaten in the ſame day, in which the Sacrifice was offered, <hi>Lev.</hi> 7. 15. and <hi>Lev.</hi> 22. 30. muſt not, nor cannot be underſtood of the ſame Ceremonial day, but it may, and muſt be underſtood of the ſame Natural day.</p>
                     <p>Object. 15. <hi>What need had they to keep their Religious Feaſts in the night after the Sabbath? was not the whole day from Sun-ſet to Sun-ſet ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> It was not ſufficient, becauſe they muſt feaſt upon their Evening ſacrifices, as well as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:44298:133"/>
becauſe many times the Evening ſacrifices were not finiſhed till Sun-ſet, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 35. 14. therefore they muſt of neceſſity have the night after as the appointed ſeaſon for the ſolemnity of their Religious Suppers; and therefore the Sun-ſet Evening before was not the beginning of the Natural day, it was but the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the new day to the perſon purified, he muſt of neceſſity begin his new day then, or elſe he could not partake in the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities of their Sacrifices the day following; but the Sun-ſet Evening after the Sabbath was a natural part of the former day, and the proper Feaſt of the Sabbath was then celebrated; and the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> hath reference to this Cuſtome, when he ſaith, <hi>Ye ſhall have a Song as in the Night, when a holy Solemnity is kept,</hi> Iſa. 30. 29. for they kept their Religious Suppers till Mid-night, and it is evident that all their Religious Feaſts were kept with ſongs and with ſuch like expreſſions of joy in the Meſſiah for his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, <hi>Eſ.</hi> 23. 15. <hi>Deu.</hi> 16. 15. <hi>Judg.</hi> 21. 19, 21. and in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, all kind of ſadneſſe and mourning was forbidden at their ſolemn Feaſts, becauſe it did prophane that joyful Ordinance, <hi>Lev.</hi> 10. 19. <hi>Neh.</hi> 8. 10.</p>

                     <p>The <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors ſay, That not onely the ſacrifice of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Peace-offerings (but of other kinds of ſacrifices alſo) might be eaten all the night long till break of day; As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, The Nazarites Ram, and the bread that came with it, whether it were the portion of the Prieſts, or the portion of the Owners, Theſe might be eaten all the night long til break of day; and the ſame law they ſay was for the Sin-offerings, and for the Treſpas-offerings, &amp; for the Peace-offerings of the Congregation, and for the reſidue of the Meat-offerings: <hi>All theſe</hi> (ſay the <hi>Hebrew</hi>

                     <p>In like ſort, they ſay of the reſidue of the Burnt-offerings, that they might lye burning upon the Altar all the night long untill the morning; that is (ſay they) till break of day, <hi>Lev.</hi> 6. 9. but yet they do alſo correct that Interpretation; for they ſay, <hi>Our wiſe men have ſaid, that the Prieſts might not let the fats or peeces of the Burnt-offering lye burning upon the Altar, but untill Mid-night, for fear of Tranſgreſſion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors ſay alſo, that they might continue feaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the fleſh of the Paſchal Lamb till morning, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 10. that is (ſay they) till break of day; but yet they ſay alſo that none of the company might eat again after he had ſlept, though it were in the beginning of the night. See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 10. Hence it is evident that they did allow none to make any more but one diſtinct meal of the Paſchal Lamb; and truly ſo ſmall a creature needed not ſo long a time to feaſt on it (but their vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Peace-offerings which they offered with the Paſchal Lamb, and in that reſpect did call them the Paſſeover, they might feaſt upon that fleſh till day-break, for they had two dayes allowance to eat them by the Law, <hi>Lev.</hi> 7. 17, 18.) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeeing they might make but one meal of the Lamb-Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, why ſhould any man think of a longer time to feaſt on it than till the Mid-night Morning? if it had been requiſite to feaſt on it till day break, our Saviour would have improved the full time; but it is evident that he did finiſh all by Mid-night, not onely the Supper of the Paſchal Lamb, but alſo the Peace-offerings, which he adjoyned to the Paſchal Lamb, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13. 12. (This 12. Ver. ſaith, when he was ſet down again, namely, after he had ended the Lamb-Paſſeover in Verſe 2. then he aroſe from Supper, and waſhed his Diſciples feet, Verſe 3. then he ſate down again to feaſt upon the Chagigah-Paſſeover, Verſe 12. At which Feaſt they uſed to drink two or three cups of Wine, which our Saviour improved for the inſtitution of his own Supper; they had no common Supper this night as ſome unadviſedly ſpeak, but all the fleſh they ate was holy fleſh, and all their Feaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was with Religious joy for their Redemption) together with his long Exhortations, Thankſgivings, Prayers and Pſames.

I apprehend it was much about the time of Mid-night, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before, when he had ended all.</p>
                     <p>And it doth further appear that the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors did fear it might be a Tranſgreſſion to continue at their Religious Feaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">The Jews ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the firſt half of the night to be a part of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer day in the caſe of their religi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

See Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 23. 20. By this Teſtimony it is evident, that all their holy things were eaten in the ſame day, and in half the night, except their voluntary Peace-offerings, for they had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance from the Law to feaſt on that fleſh two dayes, and one night, <hi>Lev.</hi> 7. 17, 18. <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 2. 10.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Conſider this well; for though the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors do ſometimes ſay, that the fats and the peeces of the Burnt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offering may lye burning upon the Altar all night till break of day, yet they do alſo ſay, that their Wiſe men did adviſe the Prieſts not to continue the burning upon the Altar any longer than till Mid-night, and in <hi>Exod.</hi> 23. 8. the Lord ſaith, <hi>The fat of my Feaſt ſhall not remain untill the morning</hi> therefore it muſt be wholly conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with fire before day-break.

                        </gap>cially at feſtival times; for at feſtival times, ſaith <hi>Maymony, The Prieſts muſt take away the aſhes from the Altar at the beginning of the third part of the night; But on Reconciliation-days they took away the aſhes at Mid-night.</hi> See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 6. 10. By this <hi>Hebrew</hi> Canon it is evident that they could not continue the burning of the fats and peeces of the Evening ſacrifices untill day-break without tranſgreſſing this neceſſary order in cleanſing the Altar by way of preparation to the morning ſacrifices, for they might not do any other work about the morning ſacrifice till the aſhes were taken from the Altar, for that was the firſt work in order to the morning ſacrifice, and they could not do that work untill the burning of the fats, and of the peeces of the Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſacrifices were finiſhed; therefore they might not continue the burning any longer than till Mid-night (at ſometimes at leaſt)
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:44298:134"/>
without Tranſgreſſion, eſpecially in the night before the day of Reconciliation, for then the Prieſts muſt take away the aſhes from the Altar at Mid-night; and by this it is evident that the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors held that the morning (namely the root of it) began at Mid-night, becauſe they did then give order to ſet things in a readineſſe for the morning Sacrifice; and after this work was done, they had many other things to ſet in order be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they could offer the morning Sacrifice, and the uſual time of killing the morning Sacrifice was before Sun-riſing, but on Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation-day it was killed at day-break. See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Num.</hi> 28. 4. and <hi>Lev.</hi> 16. 4.</p>
                     <p>By theſe Records of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors, we may ſee the true Reaſon why they feared it might be a Tranſgreſſion to continue the burning any longer than till Mid-night, and why they feared it might be a Tranſgreſſion to continue their Feſtival Suppers any longer than till Mid-night; it was becauſe they held the root of the morning to begin at Mid-night; And <hi>Maymony</hi> ſaith, <hi>Grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full is a Commandement that is done in the hour of the ſame.</hi> See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 6. 10.</p>

                     <p>Object. 17. <hi>How can you prove that the Paſſeover-Supper was cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated in the night of the fourteenth day, ſeeing you confeſſe that the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth day began that night at Sun-ſet; and the</hi> Hebrew <hi>Doctors affirm, that the fleſh of the Paſchal Lamb was eaten in the fifteenth night; how then can that night appertain both to the fourteenth, and to the fifteenth day?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> It was the fifteenth night, according to the date of the perſon purified, as I have opened the matter in chap. 4. and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, but in regard of the Feaſt it did ſtill properly appertain to the fourteenth day. As for example, if a <hi>Iew</hi> were defiled on the Paſſeover day by any of the lighter ſorts of uncleaneſſes, what courſe muſt he take that he might not be deprived of the Paſſeover Feaſt? the anſwer is, he muſt bathe or baptiſe himſelf in Water, at the looking forth of the evening, that is to ſay, in the after-noon; And what then? might hee then carry his Lamb to the Temple to be ſacrificed? No, he might not yet go himſelf to the Temple, becauſe his clenſing was not fully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat; but yet he might joyn with others, and cauſe others to kill the Paſſeover for him, becauſe he was now in his firſt degree of cleanſing, and then as ſoon as the Sun was fully gone down upon him he was fully clean, and then he began the date of his day of cleaneneſſe, and then as ſoon as three Stars appeared after Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, he might ſit down with the reſt of that Society to eat the Paſſeover. See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Num.</hi> 9. 10.</p>
                     <p>And thus the Sun-ſet evening was the fifteenth day to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon purified, and yet it was properly the fourteenth day ſtill, in reſpect of feaſting on the Sacrifices; and thus theſe two actions of Feaſting and Purifying may wel bear the date of two ſeverall days thus enter-woven together, without any confuſion or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It was neceſſary that the Perſon purified ſhould begin the date of his new day as ſoon as his Ceremonial cleaneneſſe was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by the ſetting of the Sun upon him after his Baptiſing, as

I have opened the matter in chap. 4.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 It was alſo as neceſſary that the ſolemn act of feaſting upon the fleſh of their Sacrifices ſhould bear the date of the ſame day with the ſaid Sacrifices; 1 Becauſe the act of Feaſting received no new degree of cleaneneſſe at Sun-ſet, as the perſon purified did. 2. Becauſe the act of feaſting in the latter evening after Sun-ſet had a neceſſary dependence upon the act of Sacrificing in the former evening, for the act of feaſting on the Holy fleſh in the latter evening was but to help on the Spiritual appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of that document that was typified and exhibited by the ſacrifice in the former evening; therefore ſeeing the act of feaſting had ſuch a neceſſary dependence upon the act of ſacrificing, I ſee no reaſon why this continued Sacramental Paſſeover ſhould bear the date of two ſeveral proper Natural days; I ſee no reaſon why the act of feaſting ſhould bear the date of the fifteenth day, except it be only in relation to the date of the perſon purified, and thus <hi>Maymony</hi> above cited muſt be underſtood, that the fleſh of the Paſchal Lamb was eaten on the fifteenth night, namely, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the date of the perſon purified, though in regard of the Feaſt it ſelf it was but the fourteenth night ſtill, as in my next an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer at fifthly I have cited his words.</p>

of the fifteenth day to the perſon purified.</p>
                     <p>2 It is evident, that the Sun-ſet evening is a true part of the ſame fourteenth day by Creation, by <hi>Numb.</hi> 9. 11. In the ſecond Month, in the fourteenth day of the Month, between the two evenings they ſhall do it, with unleavened Cakes, and bitter Herbs ſhall they eat it.</p>
                     <p>In this text <hi>Moſes</hi> doth ſpeak of a Two-fold action to be done in the evening of the fourteenth day of the month; He ſpeaks of doing it, namely according to the Command, that is to ſay, of ſacrificing it between the two evenings; Secondly, He ſpeaks of the act of feaſting with unleavened Cakes, and bitter Herbs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Moſes</hi> doth not diſtribute theſe two Sacramental actions unto two ſeverall Natural days, but commands them both to bee done in the ſame fourteenth day of the month.</p>
                     <p>3 It is evident by <hi>Joſ.</hi> 10. 3. that they kept the Feaſt of the Paſchal Lamb on the fourteenth day of the Month at Even; <hi>Joſhuae</hi> names only the time of Feaſting (though the time of Sacrificing muſt be underſtood) he ſaith plainly, that it muſt be feaſted on in the fourteenth day of the Month at even, I cannot ſee how any man that loves plain truth can deny the Sun-ſet evening to be a true part of the former day.</p>
                     <p>4 It is evident that the latter evening was a true part of the fourteenth day, becauſe the ſeven days of unleavened Bread have ſeven latter evenings belonging to them, beſides the latter evening of the fourteenth day, ſo that they obſerved eight feſtival Evenings together, and ſo <hi>Joſephus</hi> doth number them, in <hi>Antiq. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>ch.</hi> 5. and hence it follows, that the Feſtival Supper which belonged to the laſt day of unleavened Bread, which was the one and twentieth day of the Month, did alſo bear the date of the two and twentieth day to the perſon purified, and this latter evening was the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed ſeaſon for all their Holy Feſtival Suppers, and often-times it was little enough, for they muſt boyl and roſt all the fleſh of their Peace-offerings, which were of the greater kind, as ſheep and Oxen, (for no Fowls were allowed for Peace-offerings. See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Bev.</hi> 3. 6.) this did much increaſe the quantity of their Proviſions, and therefore it required the longer time both to Cook it, and to feaſt on it; and all theſe days of Feaſting were commanded to be done with great ſolemnity, eſpecially the firſt and the laſt. and with many relations of Gods goodneſſe for
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:44298:137"/>
their deliverance out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and with Songs and Pſalms of praiſe, <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 15. <hi>Exod.</hi> 23. 15. <hi>Deut.</hi> 27. 7. See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 8. and in this reſpect the latter evening was a competent time for theſe religious Solemnities, and to continue the time of feaſting longer, was a tranſgreſſion: for it is expreſly commanded in <hi>Lev.</hi> 7. 15. that the holy fleſh muſt be eaten in the ſame day in which it was ſacrificed; But if the Sun-ſet evening had been the true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Natural day, then this Holy fleſh could not have been eaten the ſame day, as I have noted the reaſon thereof for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, and then God by <hi>Moſes</hi> had commanded us to do that which is not poſſible to be done; therefore the Sun-ſet evening is a true part of the ſame Natural day wherein the fleſh was ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Maymony</hi> ſaith (as I noted in objection ſixteen) that the Prieſts did eat the two Loaves which were preſented to the Lord with the Meat-offering of the Congregation on the day of Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticoſt, in the ſame day, and in half the night, as the fleſh of the moſt holy things were. See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Levit.</hi> 23. 20. ſo then, in the judgement of the ancient <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors (for <hi>Maymony</hi> doth but record their judgement) the latter evening till mid-night was a true part of the ſame Natural day, in which the Sacrifices were offered, though yet notwithſtanding the purified perſon began the date of his new day at the Sun-ſet afore.</p>
                     <p>5 Thus (ſaith <hi>Maymony)</hi> after he had related divers circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces about the Paſſeover, then is brought in a Table furniſhed with bitter Herbs, unleavened Bread, and the Body of the Paſchal Lamb, and the fleſh <hi>Chagigah,</hi> which is (ſaith he) for the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth day of the Month, he doth not ſay which is for the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth day of the Month (though otherwiſe he doth call this time the fifteenth day of the Month) both are true in a right ſenſe, namely in the ſenſe formerly given) and in another place <hi>Maymony</hi> ſaith thus, The evening of the fourteenth of <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

He makes the time of feaſting to belong to the fourteenth day; and ſecondly, he preferres this evening to the evening of the Feſtival Sabbaths, and therefore preſcribes a greater puniſhment for ſervile work done on this evening, than for working in the evening before the Feſtival Sabbaths, for ſo is the compariſon to be made, as I
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:44298:138"/>
have noted it elſewhere, becauſe in this evening was ſolemnized the proper Feaſt of the fourteenth day; but the evening before was but in way of preparation to the Sabbath it ſelf. Thirdly, <hi>Maymony</hi> ſaith thus, They ſearched out Leaven in the beginning of the night of the fourteenth day; <hi>Maymony</hi> calls the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Feaſt of the unleavened Bread the fourteenth night, and yet in another place he calleth it the fifteenth day.</p>
                     <p>Thus have I proved, not only by Scripture, but alſo by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors, that the Sun-ſet evening is a true part of the former day, though it be alſo the beginning of a new day to the perſon purified, by a Ceremonial inſtitution.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>In theſe words you ſee that <hi>Maymony</hi> doth not hold this faſt to begin with the tenth day at the Sun-ſet Evening, according to the date of the new day of the perſon purified; but in the evening of the ninth day, next before the tenth day<hi>:</hi> And <hi>May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> ſaith moreover, <hi>That they muſt abide in their affliction a little in the night after the tenth day.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This early beginning, and this late ending of this faſting-day doth increaſe the length of this day, beyond the length of any other faſting-day, or of any other Sabbath day.</p>

                     <p n="3">3 Hence it is alſo evident, that <hi>Moſes</hi> did not hold the naturall beginning of the tenth day to begin at the Sun-ſet evening of the ninth day, for then <hi>Moſes</hi> words ſhould have run thus, From the tenth of the month from the Evening; but <hi>Moſes</hi> doth not ſay ſo, but from the ninth of the month from the Evening, either he muſt mean it to begin from the Sacrifice-Evening of the ninth day, as <hi>Maymony</hi> expounds it; or ſecondly, from the latter Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ninth day (as a true part of the ninth day) as the Seventy underſtand it; or thirdly, from the Ceremonial be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the ninth day, which begins at the Sun-ſet Evening before the ninth day. But then,</p>
                     <p n="4">4 If you will take this phraſe from Even to Even to be from the Evening of the ninth day, according to the date of the perſon purified, then all the ninth day muſt be a faſting day as well as the tenth day, for the Evening of the ninth day is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the ninth day according to the date of the perſon pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified; but if you deſire to avoid this groſſe abſurdity, then you muſt grant that the natural Evening of the ninth day did not begin, but end the ninth day, as the Seventy Interpreters do carry it.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 They that do place the natural Evening at the beginning of the ninth day, and yet do allow the Sacrifice Evening to be placed at the end of the ninth day, they do thereby place the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural morning of the ninth day between the two Evenings of the ninth day, and ſo they do make the morning Sacrifice to be killed between the two Evenings; but when men will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the truth in the love of it, it is juſt with God to let them run into ſuch abſurd conſequences as theſe.</p>

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:44298:139"/>
ſuch a ſtrict abſtinence as they did the day of Reconciliation; for the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors ſay, <hi>That it was lawfull for them to eat in the night, when the feaſt was on the morrow.</hi> See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Nu.</hi> 9. 10. By this teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of <hi>Maymony,</hi> it is evident that they began all their other ſolemn faſting-dayes in the morning, and not in the evening before, except the day of Reconciliation only; therfore no other publick faſting-day was of ſuch a length as this yeerly faſting-day was.</p>
                     <p n="7">7 Neither was any other Sabbath of ſuch a length for ſtrict Reſt as this faſting-Sabbath was, for they muſt begin the ſtrict Reſt of this day, either in the Sacrifice Evening of the ninth day, or at the beginning of the latter Evening of the ninth: But they did not begin the ſtrict Reſt neither of their feſtival Sabbaths, nor of the Sabbath or ſeventh day in the Evening before, as they did this yeerly faſting-Sabbath; For <hi>Maymony</hi> ſaith, <hi>Such works as may be done on the Evening of a Feaſt-day, they do not upon a Feaſt-day, &amp;c.</hi> See <hi>Ain.</hi> in 23. 7. By this teſtimony it is evident, that they did not hold the Evening before their feſtival-Sabbaths to be as holy as the day it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>2 <hi>Maymony</hi> ſaith, It is unlawful to do works in the Evening of the feſtival Sabbaths, from the time of the Evening Sacrifice, and forwards, Even as on the Evenings of the Sabbaths; and who ſo doth work in them ſhall never ſee a ſign of a Beſſing, and he is to be rebuked, and to be made to leave off by force, though he is not for it to be ſcourged or excommunicated, except in the Evening of the Paſſeover after Mid-day whoſo doth work therein after Mid-day, is to be ſcourged, or excommunicated with the <hi>Niddui;</hi> for the Evening of the fourteenth day of <hi>Niſhan,</hi> is not like the Evening of other feſtival dayes, becauſe in it are the Feaſt, and the killing of Sacrifices. See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 23. 5.</p>
                     <p>Two things are obſervable from this Record of <hi>Maymony.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1 That the <hi>Jews</hi> did make ſome kind of preparation, both to their feſtival-Sabbaths, and to their Sabbath or ſeventh day, from the time of the Evening Sacrifice, and forwards.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Hence it is evident, that the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors did not eſteem any part of the Evening before their Sabbaths, to be as holy as the day following, becauſe they did neither ſcourge, nor excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate any man, for working in the Evening before their Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths, as they did for working in the Paſſeover Evening; and the reaſon is plain, becauſe they eſteemed both the parts of the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over-Evening
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:44298:140"/>
to be the very day of the Paſſeover it ſelf; but it ſeems they did not eſteem the Evening before the Sabbath to be any true part of the Sabbath it ſelf, for doubtleſſe, if they had eſteemed it as a true part of the Sabbath it ſelf, they would not onely have ſcourged and excommunicated ſuch perſons, that did preſume to work in the Evening, before the Sabbath, but alſo they would have ſtoned them to death, if they had preſumptuouſly bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the reſt of the holy Sabbath, <hi>Numb.</hi> 15. 35. And as <hi>Maymony</hi> makes the Evening of the Paſſeover, not like the Evening that went before their feſtival Sabbaths, nor like the Evening that went before their weekly Sabbath; So I may ſay of the Evening that went before the day of Attonement, that it was more ſtrict for holy reſt than the Evening that went before any of the other Sabbaths.</p>
                     <p>From all the Premiſes, I conclude, that no day in all the yeer was commanded to be of ſuch a length for ſtrict Reſt as this day was, for the ſtrict Reſt of this day, and the ſtrict Faſt of this day began in the Sacrifice Evening, or elſe at the beginning of the latter Evening of the ninth day, and it continued not onely till a little after the Sun-ſet Evening of the tenth day, as <hi>Maymony</hi> ſaith, But alſo it continued longer, for ſome of the holy duties of the tenth day, could not be finiſhed till Mid-night after; for</p>
                     <p n="1">1 The Prieſts muſt eat their part of the publick Sin-offering, <hi>Num.</hi> 29. 11. which muſt be eaten in the ſame day in which it was offered, <hi>Lev.</hi> 6. 26. (as other Sacrifices were, <hi>Lev.</hi> 7. 15, 18.) and yet the Prieſts could not eat the holy fleſh of this publick Sin-offering till after Sun-ſet; for the faſt of this day was not fully ended till after Sun-ſet, and therefore alſo they might not begin to Cook that holy fleſh untill the Faſt was fully ended. Hence it follows, that the ſame day did ſtill continue till after Sun-ſet, yea untill it was Mid-night.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 The Prieſts had another work to do within the limits of this tenth day, namely, they muſt burn all the fats and peeces of all the publick Evening-ſacrifices of this day (which were many) and ſome of their Evening-ſacrifices were alſo offered neer unto Sun-ſet, and therefore this work and duty of burning would require not only the more diligence, but alſo the more time, to finiſh this <note place="margin">

3 It appears, that ſome of the works which appertained to the morning-ſacrifice of this tenth day, muſt begin at Mid-night, and that ſome of the works which muſt be done about the Evening-ſacrifice were ſuch as could not be ended untill the Mid-night after.</p>
                     <p>For the firſt work that muſt be done on this day in preparation to the Morning-ſacrifice was the taking away the aſhes from the Altar, and theſe aſhes they muſt begin to take away at Mid-night, as <hi>Maymony</hi> ſaith. See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 6. 10. And in another place he ſaith, they took away the aſhes at Mid-night, and orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the wood, &amp;c. and at the break of day they began to kill the daily Morning-ſacrifice. See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 16. 4.</p>
                     <p>In like ſort they could not finiſh the burning of all the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-ſacrifices of this day till Mid-night, as I have ſhewed above from <hi>Lev.</hi> 6. 9. and yet over and above this full day from Mid-night to Mid-night, they began their ſtrict Faſt, and their ſtrict Reſt, in the Evening of the ninth day, which did increaſe the length of this day to be an extraordinary long Faſting-Sabbath.</p>
                     <p>Hence I conclude, That the beginning of this day cannot be alleged as an exemplary pattern, neither for the beginning of any other Faſting-day, nor yet for the beginning of our Lords day, as it is intended by thoſe that allege it for the beginning and ending of the <hi>Jews</hi> weekly Sabbath from Even to Even.</p>

That the Sun-ſet evening is truly come as ſoon as ever the Body of the Sun is gone out of ſight, and that Darkneſſe is then begun, becauſe the ſhining of the Sun is gone from off the face of the earth, and Darkneſſe is ſaid to begin at the going down of the Sun, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 17. and then the <hi>Jews</hi> began to ſet their Night-watches, and then the purified perſon began the date of the day of his cleaneneſſe, and therefore if the Sabbath it ſelf did begin in the evening at all, it began then, namely according to the date of the day of the purified perſon, which began as ſoon as ever the Body of the Sun was gone out of ſight, as I have ſhewed in chap. 4. and then if <hi>Nehemiah</hi> did not ſet a Watch at the Gates of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> till the darkneſſe in the Skie was more than the light in the Skie, he did not that which was ſufficient to preſerve the Holy reſt of the Holy Sabbath, eſpecially ſeeing they began to make ſome preparation to the obſervation of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, from the time of the Evening Sacrifice before, as I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved from the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors.</p>

before the Sabbath) But what if the Greek doth ſignifie no more but as Maſter <hi>Norton</hi> ſaith, when the evening was coming? yet that tranſlation makes the difference of time ſo ſmall that it is not worth the ſpeaking of, for in the like caſe <hi>Mark</hi> ſaith, <hi>That at the evening, when the Sun was ſet, the</hi> Jews <hi>brought their diſeaſed perſons to Chriſt to be cured,</hi> Mark 1. 32. but <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith, <hi>It was when the Sun was ſetting,</hi> Luk. 4. 40. that is to ſay, when the evening was coming, for in proper ſpeech, the latter evening cannot be ſaid to be coming till the Sun be ſetting.</p>
                     <p>And ſecondly, It ſeems to me that <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea</hi> durſt not go to <hi>Pilate</hi> to beg the dead Body before Sun-ſet, for fear of the diſpleaſure of the High Prieſts, and therefore he delayed his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Pilate</hi> untill the High Prieſts had firſt gone and beſought <hi>Pilate</hi> that their leggs might be broken, and that they might bee taken down, becauſe it was the time of their preparation to their High Feſtival Sabbath-Supper, for <hi>Joſeph</hi> knew that the High Prieſts were deſirous that Chriſt ſhould hang upon the Croſſe for his greater ignominy, as long as other curſed Malefactors uſed to do, and that was untill the Sun was ſet, and in this ſenſe <hi>Joſhua</hi> did underſtand the Law to mean, namely, that they might <note place="margin">Deut. 21. 23.</note> hang upon the Tree after the night was begun (which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun at Sun-ſet) and therefore he did not command the dead Bodies of the curſed Kings to be taken down from the Tree untill the Sun was down, <hi>Joſ</hi> 8. 29.</p>
                     <p>I grant that formerly I have expounded this clauſe in <hi>Deut.</hi> 21. 23. <hi>Thou ſhalt not let his Carkaſſe hang all night upon the tree,</hi> to mean (not at all in the night) but ſince then I finde upon better examination that I was in an error, though Maſter <hi>Norton</hi> takes it for a truth, and ſo in like ſort he takes ſome plain truths for great errors; but this ſentence, they ſhal not hang all night, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, that they may hang ſome part of the night upon the tree, provided they were buried the ſame day, namely in the ſame Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural day, which laſted after Sun-ſet untill Mid-night, as I have ſhewed in chap. 5. in my anſwer to Object. 16.</p>
                     <p>And in this reſpect <hi>Ioſhua</hi> let the dead Bodies of the Kings hang ſtill upon the Tree untill the Sun was ſet; that is to ſay, untill the night was begun; but if this command of burying them in the ſame day had meant in the ſame Ceremonial day, then the dead Bodies might not continue hanging on the Tree untill the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:44298:142"/>
Sun was ſet, except they had been buried ſome diſtinct time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Sun-ſet; this clauſe therefore <hi>[in the ſame day]</hi> muſt be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood not of the ſame Ceremonial day which ended at Sun-ſet, but of the ſame Natural day which continued after Sun-ſet till mid-night, as I have ſhewed more at large in Chapter five, in my anſwer to Objection ſixteen, and in chap. 4. <hi>ult.</hi> and in other places alſo.</p>
                     <p>The chief Prieſts were firſt in their requeſt to <hi>Pilate,</hi> becauſe it was the time of their preparation to their ſolemn High Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-Supper, for it was the firſt day of unleavened bread, which was a high Sabbath, and their Feſtival-Supper was to begin at Star-light, therefore they beſought <hi>Pilate</hi> that their leggs might be broken, and that they might be taken away, <hi>Joh.</hi> 19. 31. thus you ſee that the Prieſts in regard of their preparation to their Sabbath-Supper were firſt in their requeſt unto <hi>Pilate,</hi> preſently upon this <hi>Pilate</hi> commanded that their leggs ſhould be broken, and <hi>Joſeph</hi> perceiving their requeſt, firſt did wiſely eſpy the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of time, and without delay he went boldly unto <hi>Pilate,</hi> and beſought him, that he might take away the Body of Jeſus, and <hi>Pilate</hi> gave him leave; he came therefore and took the Body of Jeſus, <hi>Joh.</hi> 19. 38. this was all done in the neck of one another, and this time is recorded by <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Mark,</hi> to be when the Sun-ſet evening was done.</p>
                     <p>From the Premiſes I reaſon thus; If the Sun-ſet evening was come before <hi>Ioſeph</hi> went to <hi>Pilate</hi> to begge the Body of Chriſt, then the Sabbath Star might well be riſen before the Body of Chriſt could be incloſed in the heart of the earth, for <hi>Ioſeph</hi> had many things to do after he had the grant of the dead Body, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it could be incloſed in his Grave; Firſt, he went to the Shops to buy ſeverall peeces of Linnen to wrap the dead Body in, according to the <hi>Iews</hi> manner, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20. 6, 7. (as we may ſee the manner in <hi>Lazarus</hi> burial, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 11. 44.) and <hi>Nicodemus</hi> alſo did take up ſome time to imbalm his Body, which alſo was done with many circumſtances according to the <hi>Iews</hi> cuſtome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <p>Therefore ſeeing theſe holy Women did all this work after the burial and after the Sabbath began to lighten, it is an evident proof that the Sabbath it ſelf did not begin neither at the Sun-ſet eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, when the perſon purified began the date of his new day, nor yet at the riſing of the evening ſtarre, for if the Sabbath it ſelf had been begun at either of theſe times, then the holy Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men had moſt groſly broken the holy reſt of the Sabbath; But the Holy Text doth witneſſe on their ſide that they reſted the Sabbath, according to the Commandment, <hi>Luk.</hi> 23. 56.</p>

                        </gap> I conclude from this practiſe of the holy Women, that though the evening before the Sabbath doth bear the date of the day following to the perſon purified, yet in proper ſpeaking it is no part of the Sabbath it ſelf, it is only to be eſteemed the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath but by way of preparation, and no more.</p>

Objct. 2. <hi>It ſeems to me that the Sabbath it ſelf did begin and end at the Sun ſet Evening by the</hi> Jews <hi>practiſe, for they held it unlawful before the Sun-ſet Evening was come for our Saviour to heal diſeaſed perſons; But after the Sun-ſet Evening was come, all manner of diſeaſed perſons came flocking to him for cure,</hi> Mar. 1. 32. <hi>Hence it appears that the</hi> Jews <hi>held the Sabbath to be fully ended as ſoon as the Sun-ſet Evening was come.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is but the bare conjecture that they forbore to bring their ſick perſons till the Sabbath was ended: I deny it to be the very reaſon, I beleeve the onely reaſon why they came no ſooner, was becauſe they had no ſooner intelligence of his mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous power to heal; you do barely affirm that the <hi>Jews</hi> in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral held it unlawful for our Saviour to heal diſeaſed perſons upon the Sabbath day, but you are deceived. <hi>Tremelius</hi> doth teſtifie from the ancient <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors that they held the contrary: They held that the perill of life did drive away the Sabbath; that is to ſay, they held it lawful to uſe any means to prevent the danger of death upon the Sabbath day. See <hi>Tremelius</hi> his <hi>Annot.</hi> in <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 8. in the <hi>Syriack</hi> Teſtament; Mr. <hi>Ainſworth</hi> alſo doth affirm from the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors, that they held it to be a Sabbath days work to viſit the ſick; for they held that perill of life did drive away the Sabbath. See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 10. See alſo my former Treatiſe.</p>
                     <p>2 I do alſo apprehend by the circumſtances of the ſtory, that the <hi>Jews</hi> of <hi>Capernaum</hi> were not offended with our Saviour for his miraculous cure, which he did upon that Sabbath day (as the malignant Scribes and Phariſees ſometimes were) in healing one in the Synagogue that had an unclean ſpirit, <hi>Mark.</hi> 1. 27.</p>
                     <p>3 They took no offence at him for the curing of <hi>Peters</hi> wives mother of her Feavor, preſently after he had left the ſaid Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue, v 31. Therefore ſeeing they found no fault with Chriſt for neither of theſe miraculous cures before the Sabbath was ended, doubtleſs they did not forbear to bring their diſeaſed perſons in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Sabbath (for they admired the power of God in theſe miracles) and therefore as ſoon as the publick exerciſe was ended, they ſpread his fame, verſe 28. and thereupon a multitude of the diſeaſed perſons of <hi>Capernaum</hi> came to him for cure with all the poſſible ſpeed they could, as it appears by their earneſt preſſing
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:44298:144"/>
after ſo ſhort a warning, for I conceive by the circumſtances of the ſtory, that it was but a little afore Sun-ſet when Chriſt left the Synagogue, and then as ſoon as he had left the Synagogue he healed <hi>Peters</hi> wives mother, which was another procuring cauſe that made the greater flocking to him; but if his miraculous cures had been done ſooner, doubtleſſe the fame thereof would have made the ſick perſons to have flocked ſooner after him.</p>
                     <p>I grant that ſome of the malignant Scribes and Phariſees did ſometimes take offence at Chriſt for his miraculous healing upon the Sabbath day; But the people in general rejoyced at all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent things that were done by him upon the Sabbath day, <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 17. for Chriſt did now heal a poor crooked wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man upon that Sabbath day, verſe 11. And when the Ruler of the Synagogue took offence at it, Chriſt (by reaſons) put him to ſilence; and the people rejoyced that Chriſt had put him to ſilence.</p>
                     <p>Therefore though ſome of the malignant <hi>Jews</hi> held erroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly that Chriſt ought not to heal upon the Sabbath day, yet that is no good argument to prove that theſe <hi>Jews</hi> of <hi>Capernaum</hi> did purpoſely detain their ſick perſons till the Sabbath was end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I deny it to be the Reaſon; I do apprehend rather that they did haſtily flock to him, rather than deliberately forbear till the Sabbath might be ended.</p>
                     <p>4 Mr. <hi>Pemble</hi> on this place ſaith, That this Evening was the Evening of the ſame day wherein Chriſt had done ſo much before, as the inference ſhews plainly.</p>
                     <p>5 It is evident to me from ſeveral teſtimonies of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors, that they held the Sun-ſet Evening after the Sabbath to be a true part of the Sabbath it ſelf, becauſe they held it lawful to <note place="margin">The Hebrew Doctors held the Sun-ſet Evening after the Sabbath, to be a true part of the Sabbath it ſelf.</note> do many things in the Sun-ſet Evening before the Sabbath, which they did not hold lawfull to be done in the Sun-ſet Evening af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Sabbath.</p>
                     <p>1 <hi>Maymony</hi> ſaith thus, <hi>The two Loaves of New Corn for the Wave-offering</hi> (on the day of Penticoſt) <hi>were not Baked on the day of Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecoſt, becauſe it was a Sabbath; nor in the Evening before, if it were a Sabbath.</hi> See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 23. 17.</p>
                     <p>Two things are evident from this Teſtimony.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 That in the judgement of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors the Sun-ſet
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:44298:144"/>
Evening after the Sabbath, was a true part of the Sabbath it ſelf, becauſe they held it unlawfull to bake the ſaid two Loaves of new corn in the Evening before the day of Penticoſt, if it were a Sabbath: But they might with out ſcruple have baked the ſaid two Loaves in the ſaid Evening before Penticoſt, as well as on any other Evening, if they had held that the Sabbath had then been fully ended. See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 23. 6, 7.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Hence it is evident, that the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors did not hold the Evening before the Sabbath to be a true part of the Sabbath it ſelf, no otherwiſe than by way of preparation.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 <hi>Mamony</hi> gives another inſtance from the time of baking the twelve Loaves of Shew-bread; he ſaith, <hi>That the twelve Loaves of the Shew-bread might not be baked on the Sabbath, nor on a Feaſt-day, but in the Evening of the Sabbath they baked it, and ſet it in order on the morrow.</hi> See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 24. 5.</p>
                     <p>Hence this is remarable in this <hi>Hebrew</hi> Record; That he makes a manifeſt difference between the Evening that goes before the Sabbath, and the Sabbath it ſelf, he calls the Evening before, [the Evening of the Sabbath] by cuſtome peculiar to the <hi>Jews,</hi> from the date of the new day to the perſon purified (as I have formerly ſhewed) he allows theſe twelve Loaves to be baked in the Evening of the Sabbath all the yeer long, except it fell out to be in the latter Evening of a Feſtival-Sabbath; and therefore it doth hence follow, that not the Evening before, but the Evening after their Feſtival-Sabbaths, was a true part of their Feſtival-Sabbaths; And ſo likewiſe <hi>Tremelius</hi> a Chriſtian <hi>Jew,</hi> doth make the Evening after the Sabbath to be true part of the Sabbath it ſelf, in his Tranſlation and note on the <hi>Syriak</hi> Teſtament in <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 1.</p>
                     <p>Therefore by the judgement of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors, the Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val-Sabbath was not ended at Sun-ſet; and thence it follows, that if their feſtival-Sabbaths were not ended at Sun-ſet, then their weekly Sabbaths were not ended at Sun-ſet.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 <hi>Maymony</hi> ſaith thus, <hi>Who ſo laboureth in the Evening of the Sabbath, he ſhall eat in the Sabbath,</hi> See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. 26.</p>
                     <p>Hence it follows, that in the judgement of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Canons, the Evening before the Sabbath was no part of the Sabbath no otherwiſe but by way of preparation to the Sabbath; for they ſay, That he that will eat in the Sabbath, muſt labour in the Evening of
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:44298:145"/>
the Sabbath, namely in the Evening before the Sabbath; This they ſpeak, as I conceive, of their laborious preparing of their Manna (according to every ones pal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t) in a readineſs againſt the Sabbath; for though the Manna was a ready food of it ſelf, without prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to ſome ſtomacks, yet not to al, til it were cooked to their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat; and it could not be prepared in this ſort without great labor, for it was ground in Mills, and beaten in Mortars, <hi>Num.</hi> 1 1. 8 And in that reſpect the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors ſay, Who ſo laboureth in the Evening of the Sabbath, ſhall eat in the Sabbath; but in caſe they neglected this work in the Evening of the Sabbath, they might not do it on the Sabbath day, but they muſt rather faſt and endure hunger for their negligence ſake.</p>
                     <p>Hence it follows, that the Evening before, was called the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Sabbath, no otherwiſe but by way of preparation, and it is called the Evening of the Sabbath from their new date to the perſon purified; his new day did ever begin at the Sun-ſet Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 <hi>Maymony</hi> ſaith thus, <hi>Such works as may be done in the Evening before a Feaſt-day they do not upon a Feaſt-day; they may not reap, nor threſh, nor winnow, nor grinde corn, nor the like upon a Sabbath day, for all theſe things may be done in the Evening of a Sabbath, killing of Beaſts, baking of bread, kneading of dough, and the like, may be done in the Evening of a Sabbath.</hi> See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 23. 7. in like ſort their laborious preparation of their Manna muſt be done in the Evening of the weekly Sabbath.</p>
                     <p>Object. 4. <hi>By the Evening of the Sabbath the</hi> Jews <hi>do not mean onely the Sun-ſet Evening, but they accounted the Sabbath Evening to begin at three a clock in the afternoon before; and in this reſpect</hi> Maymony <hi>ſaith thus, It is unlawful to do works in the Evenings of the Feſtival-Sabbaths from the time of the Evening ſacrifice, and forward (even as upon the Evening of the weekly Sabbaths) and who ſo doth work in them ſhall never ſee a ſign of bleſſing, and he is to be rebuked, and to be made to leave off by force, Though he is not for it to be ſcourged or excommunicated, except in the Evening of the Paſſeover after Mid-day; who ſo doth work therein after Mid-day, he is to be ſcourged or excommunicated with the Niddui, for the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of Niſhan is not like the Evening of other Feſtival dayes, becauſe in it are the Feaſt, and the killing of Sacrifices.</hi> See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 23. 5.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> I grant that the <hi>Jews</hi> did make ſome kind of preparation
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:44298:145"/>
both to their Feſtival-Sabbaths, and to their weekly Sabbaths alſo, from the time of the Evening-ſacrifice, and forwards, till Bed-time; for though they did not begin their day of cleanneſſe till Sun-ſet, yet in regard of the many works that were to be done againſt their Feaſt-dayes (which I have immediately named) and in regard of preparing their Manna, &amp;c. againſt the Sabbath, their wiſe men held it convenient to forbear, and leave off the ordinary works of their calling from the time of the Evening-ſacrifice, and forwards, till bed-time; and in that reſpect the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates themſelves did forbear to ſit in their Courts of Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature after the time of the Evening-ſacrifice. See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Exod.</hi> 18. 22. But this degree of preparation had no other command from God, but the general rule of conveniency.</p>
                     <p>2 It is evident from the ſaid Teſtimony, that they did not eſteem any part of the Evening, neither before, nor after Sun-ſet, to be as a true part of the Sabbath it ſelf, becauſe they did neither ſcourge nor excommunicate any man that did any ſervile work in this Evening, as they did for working in any part of the Paſſeover Evening from Mid-day till Mid-night; but if they had in their judgement eſteemed any part of the Evening before the Sabbath to be a true part of the Sabbath it ſelf, doubtleſſe they would have puniſhed ſuch Tranſgreſſors more ſeverely than for working up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Paſſeover Evening, for by <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, ſuch perſons ought to be ſtoned to death, <hi>Numb.</hi> 15. 34, 35.</p>
                     <p>Hence it follows firſt, That the Evening before the Sabbath (though it be called the Evening of the Sabbath according to their ceremonial cuſtome, yet it) was no true part of the Sabbath it ſelf, but in way of preparation onely.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, That the Sun-ſet Evening after the Sabbath was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a true part of the Sabbath it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>5 It is evident that the Evening after the Sabbath was eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be a true part of the Sabbath it ſelf, by the teſtimony of the Evangeliſt <hi>John,</hi> in Chap. 20. 19. the Text runs thus, <hi>The ſame day at Evening, being the f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Mr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> and others, allow eight Furlongs to an <hi>Engliſh</hi> or <hi>Italian</hi> mile; but the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors allow but ſeven Furlongs and a half to an <hi>Engliſh</hi> mile. See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 16. 21. The New Teſtament doth not follow the <hi>Italian</hi> Furlong, but the <hi>Greek</hi> Furlong (or <hi>ſtadium Olympicum)</hi> which contains ſix thouſand feet; and the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors ſay that two thouſand Cubits make a mile.

                        <hi>Greek</hi> Cuſtomes as frequently as they followed the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue; Therefore in reaſon as the New Teſtament was written in <hi>Greek</hi> ſo it ſhould follow the <hi>Greek ſtadium</hi> rather than the <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian;</hi> beſides, I conceive that the <hi>Italian stadium</hi> came not into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon uſe untill after the New Teſtament was written. So then by the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors account, it was eight miles from <hi>Emaus</hi> to <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> that is to ſay, it was <hi>Eight Engliſh</hi> miles: Now if you will allow but three hours time for the going of theſe eight miles, it muſt needs be after Sun-ſet when they came to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles; and after they were come, they ſpent ſome time in relating unto the Apoſtles what had happened to them the ſame day as they went to <hi>Emaus,</hi> and as they were making this Relation Jeſus came and ſtood in the midſt of them, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 36.</p>
                     <p>Theſe circumſtances conſidered, it muſt needs be after the date of the <hi>Jews</hi> Ceremonial day before Chriſt came in among them, and yet the Evangeliſt calls this time of the Evening, the ſame day in which Chriſt roſe from the dead; and ſecondly, he calls it the firſt day of the week. So then, by theſe two expreſſions the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſt puts the matter out of doubt to ſuch as will be ſatisfied by plain conſequences of Scripture, that this latter Evening when Chriſt came into the houſe to the Apoſtles, was a true part of the former day, and yet it was after Sun-ſet, and therefore it was after their Ceremonial day was begun.</p>
                     <p n="6">6 And laſtly, I may well bring hither all thoſe five Arguments which I alleged in Chap. 5. to prove the latter Evening of the fourteenth day of <hi>Niſhan</hi> to be a true part of the fourteenth day, and therefore it follows by good conſequence, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

From theſe two Scriptures compared it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that the evening before the Meſſenger came, and the morning after he was come, are termed the ſame day; therefore it follows by good conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence that the ſame day began in the evening.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> This is a ſtrange collection to prove the evening to be the beginning of the Natural day; the vanity of this collection will appear by the opening of two words in this Prophecy, which muſt not be taken as you do, in ſtrict propriety of ſpeech, but in a figurative ſenſe, I mean the word Day, and the word Dumb.</p>
                     <p>1 I ſay the word Day muſt not be taken in a ſtrict ſenſe for a proper Natural day of twenty four hours, but it muſt be taken Figuratively for a time to come, as it appears by the computa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of time; for <hi>Ezekiel</hi> is ſaid to be dumb in the ninth year of <hi>Jeconiahs</hi> captivity, in the tenth Month, and in the tenth day of the Month, <hi>Eze.</hi> 24. 1, 2. in which day <hi>Ezekiels</hi> wife dyed, verſ. 18. which was the pleaſure of his eyes, verſ. 16. and her death was for a ſign unto the <hi>Iews,</hi> that the Temple which was the pleaſure of their eyes, verſ. 21. ſhould be deſtroyed) and then in that day (namely when the Temple ſhould be deſtroyed, he that eſcapeth in that day ſhould come to <hi>Ezekiel</hi> and tell him; And in <hi>[that day]</hi> viz. in time to come, <hi>Ezekiels</hi> mouth ſhould be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened unto him which eſcaped to tell him, and then he ſhould ſpeak and be no more dumb, ver. 26, 27.</p>
                     <p>This is the Prediction; now compare the ſtory of events, and that lyes thus, The Temple was burnt on the tenth day of the fifth Month, in the eleventh year of <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> Jer. 52. 12, 13. and there is no record to be found that any Meſſenger came to <hi>Ezekiel</hi> to tell him in the ſame day, neither is it poſſible for any man to come from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to <hi>Chaldea</hi> in one Natural day of
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:44298:147"/>
twenty four hours, therefore the Meſſenger that came to him in <hi>(that day)</hi> came to him in that day which is Figuratively put for the time to come, for the Meſſenger came not to <hi>Ezekiel</hi> until ſeventeen Months after that the Temple was deſtroyed, for hee came not till the fifth day of the tenth Month, and in the twelfth year of <hi>Jeconias</hi> captivity, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 21. therefore this phraſe the ſame day muſt not be underſtood of the ſame Natural day, but of day at large, for the term day is often put for a large time to come, as in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 23. 38, 39. &amp; <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 12. and in <hi>Deut.</hi> 27. 2 See <hi>Ainſ.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Ezekiel</hi> could not chuſe but hear of the burning of the Temple long before this Meſſenger came to him, partly by the poor Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, and partly by the Souldiers, and alſo he could not chuſe but hear of the death of <hi>Gedaliah</hi> before this ſpecial Meſſenger came; but ſuch accidental tidings did not anſwer to the ſign that was given for the time of his new Prophecying, for the ſign was this, That a ſpecial Meſſenger ſhould be ſent unto him from <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> to <hi>Chaldea (in a day)</hi> that is to ſay in a time to come, and then <hi>Ezekiels</hi> mouth ſhould be opened unto him, to utter ſome new Prophecy to him, though it was not according to their expectation; for he fore-tels, that the remnant that were left ſhould likewiſe come to deſtruction.</p>

Evening before the Meſſenger came, may be taken as well for the firſt, as for the latter Evening; for God did often give Viſions to his Prophets in the firſt Evening, at the time of the Evening Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 1. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 21. <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 3, 9.

                     <p>So then from all the premiſes, I conclude, that not the Evening before, but the Evening after the Sabbath was a true part of the Sabbath it ſelf, and therefore they that take liberty to buſie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves about worldly matters in the Sun-ſet Evening after the Sabbath, do prophane that holy time that God hath ſanctified to his own uſe.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>DOubtleſſe it is a matter of neceſſary conſequence, not onely to prove cleerly the punctual time of Chriſts burial, but of his Reſurrection alſo; for if the time of his Reſurrection be uncertain, how can a doubting conſcience be ſatisfied that Chriſt lay three dayes in the heart of the earth, according to the Prediction? Therefore as I have proved the time of Chriſts bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial to be finiſhed when their Feſtival-Sabbath began to lighten by the Evening-ſtar, ſo I ſay alſo that the time of his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection was juſt about the time of Sun-riſing on the firſt day of the week.</p>
                     <p>Chriſt did not riſe from his grave before day-break, as ſome would have it, nor at day-break, as others would have it, by uncertain gueſſes. <hi>Matthew</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> went out of the door of her houſe in the firſt day of the week when it began to dawn, intending to perfume his burial with the ſweet Odors that ſhe had prepared in the Evening be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Sabbath, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 1.

By this Earthquake at Sun-riſing when <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> came to the Sepulchre, it is evident that Chriſt did not riſe out of his grave untill theſe holy women came to be witneſſes of the time of his Reſucrection. I confeſſe that many Interpreters do think that Chriſt was riſen before theſe holy Witneſſes came to the Sepulchre, but ſuch conjectures may not be admitted, for it is a point of neceſſary conſequence to be proved, That Chriſt lay three dayes in the heart of the Earth; but if you ſay, That Chriſt was riſen before theſe holy Witneſſes came, then you cannot cleerly prove that Chriſt lay three dayes in the heart of earth; for it may be demanded how long was he riſen before they came? If you ſay it was but one hour before, I may as well ſay it was ſeven or eight hours before, and then how can you ſatisfie a doubting conſcience that Chriſt lay three dayes, and three nights in the heart of the earth? I cannot think that Chriſt would ſuffer his own Prediction to remain ſo obſcure without manifeſt proof of the full accompliſhment of it: Therefore I conclude, that Chriſt roſe not out of his grave till the holy women came to be Witneſſes of the ſame, which was alſo evidently declared unto them by this Earth-quake at their coming to the Sepulchre, juſt at Sun-riſing, though they could not make that uſe of it till afterwards.</p>
                     <p>Object. 1. <hi>This Earthquake might be paſt before the holy women came to the Sepulchre, and they might know it afterward only by the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers relation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> Chriſt did never ſhew himſelf to any wicked man after his Reſurrection, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 19. <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 20, 22. <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 41. Therefore it is not like that he would make the Roman Souldiers to be the only Witneſſes of this Earthquake which did evidence the time
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:44298:148"/>
of his Reſurrection. I conceive the holy women would not give much credit to the teſtimony of the Roman Souldiers, except this Earthquake had been general to all the parts of the City, as wel as to that particular place, but it ſeems to me that this Earthquake was not generally ſpread over the City, but it was limited only to that particular place where Chriſts Sepulchre <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>From all the premiſes it is evident, that Chriſt lay in the heart of the earth about four hours of the ſixth day, and the whole Sabbath, and about five hours of the firſt day of the week, namely, from Mid-night till Sun-riſing; and after this ſort Chriſt lay three dayes, and three nights, in the heart of the Earth.</p>
                     <p>But thoſe that begin the Sabbath at the Sun-ſet-Evening can never prove that Chriſt lay three dayes in the heart of the Earth: Therefore that opinion muſt needs be of evill conſequence: Firſt, Becauſe it falſifies the ſaid Prediction.
